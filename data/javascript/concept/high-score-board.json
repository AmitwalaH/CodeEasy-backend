    "introduction": "# Introduction\n\n## Explanation\n\nBesides primitive data types like `number` and `string`, there is another important data type in JavaScript called `object`.\nObjects are collections of key-value pairs.\nAs such, they can be used in the same way as what are often referred to as maps or dictionaries in other languages.\n\nIn other languages, all values in a map often need to have the same data type.\nIn JavaScript, only the type of the key is restricted: it has to be a `string`.\nThe values inside one object can have different types.\nThey can be primitive types like numbers but also arrays, other objects or even functions.\nThis makes objects very versatile so that they are also key entities for [object-oriented programming][oop] (OOP) in JavaScript.\n\nIn the following, we will focus on objects as collections or maps.\nOther use cases of objects will be covered in other concepts, see e.g., [Classes][concept-classes].\n\n## Creating an Object\n\nYou create an object using curly brackets.\nYou can also directly include some entries.\nFor that, state the key first, followed by a colon and the value.\n\n```javascript\nconst emptyObject = {};\n\nconst obj = {\n  favoriteNumber: 42,\n  greeting: 'Hello World',\n  useGreeting: true,\n  address: {\n    street: 'Trincomalee Highway',\n    city: 'Batticaloa',\n  },\n  fruits: ['melon', 'papaya'],\n  addNumbers: function (a, b) {\n    return a + b;\n  },\n};\n```\n\nThe trailing comma after the last entry is optional in JavaScript.\n\nYou might wonder why the keys are not wrapped in quotation marks although they are supposed to be strings.\nThis is a short-hand notation.\nIf the key follows the naming rules for a JavaScript [identifier][mdn-identifier], you can omit the quotation marks.\nFor keys with special characters in the name, you need to use the usual string notation.\n\n```javascript\nconst obj = {\n  '1keyStartsWithNumber': '...',\n  'key/with/slashes': '...',\n  'key-with-dashes': '...',\n  'key with spaces': '...',\n  '#&()[]{}èä樹keyWithSpecialChars': '...',\n};\n```\n\n## Retrieving a Value\n\nThere are two ways to retrieve the value for a given key, dot notation and bracket notation.\n\n```javascript\nconst obj = { greeting: 'hello world' };\n\nobj.greeting;\n// => hello world\n\nobj['greeting'];\n// => hello world\n\n// Bracket notation also works with variables.\nconst key = 'greeting';\nobj[key];\n// => hello world\n```\n\nUsing the dot notation as a shorthand has the same restriction as omitting the quotation marks.\nIt only works if the key follows the identifier naming rules.\n\n## Adding or Changing a Value\n\nYou can add or change a value using the assignment operator `=`.\nAgain, there are dot and bracket notations available.\n\n```javascript\nconst obj = { greeting: 'hello world' };\n\nobj.greeting = 'Hi there!';\nobj['greeting'] = 'Welcome.';\n\nobj.newKey1 = 'new value 1';\nobj['new key 2'] = 'new value 2';\n\nconst key = 'new key 3';\nobj[key] = 'new value 3';\n```\n\n## Deleting an Entry\n\nYou can delete a key-value pair from an object using the `delete` keyword.\n\n```javascript\nconst obj = {\n  key1: 'value1',\n  key2: 'value2',\n};\n\ndelete obj.key1;\ndelete obj['key2'];\n```\n\n## Checking Whether a Key Exists\n\nYou can check whether a certain key exists in an object with the `hasOwnProperty` method.\n\n```javascript\nconst obj = { greeting: 'hello world' };\n\nobj.hasOwnProperty('greeting');\n// => true\n\nobj.hasOwnProperty('age');\n// => false\n```\n\n## Looping Through an Object\n\nThere is a special `for...in` loop to iterate over all keys of an object.\n\n```javascript\nconst obj = {\n  name: 'Ali',\n  age: 65,\n};\n\nfor (let key in obj) {\n  console.log(key, obj[key]);\n}\n// name Ali\n// age 65\n```\n\nTo avoid subtle errors, you should always assume the `for...in` loop visits the keys in an arbitrary order.\nAlso, be aware that `for...in` includes [inherited keys][concept-inheritance] in its iteration.\n\n[oop]: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Objects/Object-oriented_programming\n[concept-classes]: /tracks/javascript/concepts/classes\n[mdn-identifier]: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Identifier\n[concept-inheritance]: /tracks/javascript/concepts/inheritance\n",
    "instructions": "# Instructions\n\nIn this exercise, you are implementing a way to keep track of the high scores for the most popular game in your local arcade hall.\n\nYou have 5 functions to implement, mostly related to manipulating an object that holds high scores.\n\n## 1. Create a new high score board\n\nCreate a function `createScoreBoard` that creates an object that serves as a high score board.\nThe keys of this object will be the names of the players, the values will be their scores.\nFor testing purposes, you want to directly include one entry in the object.\nThis initial entry should consist of `The Best Ever` as player name and `1000000` as score.\n\n```javascript\ncreateScoreBoard();\n// returns an object with one initial entry\n```\n\n## 2. Add players to a score board\n\nTo add a player to the high score board, define the function `addPlayer`.\nIt accepts 3 parameters:\n\n- The first parameter is an existing score board object.\n- The second parameter is the name of a player as a string.\n- The third parameter is the score as a number.\n\nThe function returns the same score board object that was passed in after adding the new player.\n\n```javascript\naddPlayer({ 'Dave Thomas': 0 }, 'José Valim', 486373);\n// => {'Dave Thomas': 0, 'José Valim': 486373}\n```\n\n## 3. Remove players from a score board\n\nIf players violate the rules of the arcade hall, they are manually removed from the high score board.\nDefine `removePlayer` which takes 2 parameters:\n\n- The first parameter is an existing score board object.\n- The second parameter is the name of the player as a string.\n\nThis function should remove the entry for the given player from the board and return the board afterwards.\nIf the player was not on the board in the first place, nothing should happen to the board.\nIt should be returned as is.\n\n```javascript\nremovePlayer({ 'Dave Thomas': 0 }, 'Dave Thomas');\n// => {}\n\nremovePlayer({ 'Dave Thomas': 0 }, 'Rose Fanaras');\n// => { 'Dave Thomas': 0 }\n```\n\n## 4. Increase a player's score\n\nIf a player finishes another game at the arcade hall, a certain amount of points will be added to the previous score on the board.\nImplement `updateScore`, which takes 3 parameters:\n\n- The first parameter is an existing score board object.\n- The second parameter is the name of the player whose score should be increased.\n- The third parameter is the score that you wish to **add** to the stored high score.\n\nThe function should return the score board after the update was done.\n\n```javascript\nupdateScore({ 'Freyja Ćirić': 12771008 }, 'Freyja Ćirić', 73);\n// => {\"Freyja Ćirić\", 12771081}\n```\n\n## 5. Apply Monday bonus points\n\nThe arcade hall keeps a separate score board on Mondays.\nAt the end of the day, each player on that board gets 100 additional points.\n\nImplement the function `applyMondayBonus` that accepts a score board.\nThe function adds the bonus points for each player that is listed on that board.\nAfterwards, the board is returned.\n\n```javascript\nconst scoreBoard = {\n  'Dave Thomas': 44,\n  'Freyja Ćirić': 539,\n  'José Valim': 265,\n};\n\napplyMondayBonus(scoreBoard);\n// => { 'Dave Thomas': 144, 'Freyja Ćirić': 639, 'José Valim': 365 }\n```\n",
    "hints": "# Hints\n\n## 1. Create a new high score board\n\n- Create a new object using curly brackets.\n- Write the key as a string so the key can contain spaces.\n- Separate key and value using a colon.\n\n## 2. Add players to a score board\n\n- Use bracket notation to add a key with a name that is stored in a variable (the argument).\n- Use the assignment operator (`=`) to set a value for the new key.\n- Return the score board parameter after you added the player.\n\n## 3. Remove players from a score board\n\n- Use the [delete operator][mdn-delete].\n- Reference the key like you have done in the task before (bracket notation).\n\n## 4. Increase a player's score\n\n- First think about how to express the new value that you want to assign.\n- Then use the assignment operator like in task 2 to set that new value.\n- If you have not done so already, you can make use of the [shorthand assignment operator][mdn-shorthand-assignment] `+=`.\n\n## 5. Apply Monday bonus points\n\n- Use a `for...in` loop to go through all keys in the object.\n- For each key, set the new value as you did in task 4.\n\n[mdn-delete]: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/delete\n[mdn-shorthand-assignment]: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Addition_assignment\n[mdn-for-in]: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/for...in\n"
