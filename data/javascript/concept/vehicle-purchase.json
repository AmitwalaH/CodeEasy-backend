    "introduction": "# Introduction\n\n## Comparison\n\nIn JavaScript, numbers can be compared using the following relational and equality operators.\n\n| Comparison             | Operator  |\n| ---------------------- | --------- |\n| Greater than           | `a > b`   |\n| Greater than or equals | `a >= b`  |\n| Less than              | `a < b`   |\n| Less than or equals    | `a <= b`  |\n| (Strict) Equals        | `a === b` |\n| Not (strict) equals    | `a !== b` |\n\nThe comparison result is always a boolean value: `true` or `false`.\n\n```javascript\n1 < 3;\n// => true\n\n2 !== 2;\n// => false\n\n1 === 1.0;\n// => true\n// All numbers are floating-points, so this is different syntax for\n// the exact same value.\n```\n\nIn JavaScript, the comparison operators above can also be used to compare strings.\nIn that case, a dictionary (lexicographical) order is applied.\nYou can find a list of the exact order of all the characters [here][utf-16-list].\n\n```javascript\n'Apple' > 'Pear';\n// => false\n\n'a' < 'above';\n// => true\n\n'a' === 'A';\n// => false\n```\n\n## Conditionals\n\nA common way to conditionally execute logic in JavaScript is the if-statement.\nIt consists of the `if` keyword, a condition wrapped in round brackets and a code block wrapped in curly brackets.\nThe code block will only be executed if the condition evaluates to `true`.\n\n```javascript\nif (condition) {\n  // code that is executed if \"condition\" is true\n}\n```\n\nIt can be used stand-alone or combined with the `else` keyword.\n\n```javascript\nif (condition) {\n  // code that is executed if \"condition\" is true\n} else {\n  // code that is executed otherwise\n}\n```\n\nTo nest another condition into the `else` statement, you can use `else if`.\n\n```javascript\nif (condition1) {\n  // code that is executed if \"condition1\" is true\n} else if (condition2) {\n  // code that is executed if \"condition2\" is true\n  // but \"condition1\" was false\n} else {\n  // code that is executed otherwise\n}\n```\n\n[utf-16-list]: https://www.fileformat.info/info/charset/UTF-16/list.htm\n",
    "instructions": "# Instructions\n\nIn this exercise, you will write some code to help you prepare to buy a vehicle.\n\nYou have three tasks, one to determine if you will need to get a license, one to help you choose between two vehicles and one to estimate the acceptable price for a used vehicle.\n\n## 1. Determine if you will need a drivers license\n\nSome kinds of vehicles require a drivers license to operate them.\nAssume only the kinds `'car'` and `'truck'` require a license, everything else can be operated without a license.\n\nImplement the `needsLicense(kind)` function that takes the kind of vehicle and returns a boolean indicating whether you need a license for that kind of vehicle.\n\n```javascript\nneedsLicense('car');\n// => true\n\nneedsLicense('bike');\n// => false\n```\n\n## 2. Choose between two potential vehicles to buy\n\nYou evaluate your options of available vehicles.\nYou manage to narrow it down to two options but you need help making the final decision.\nFor that implement the function `chooseVehicle(option1, option2)` that takes two vehicles as arguments and returns a decision that includes the option that comes first in dictionary order.\n\n```javascript\nchooseVehicle('Wuling Hongguang', 'Toyota Corolla');\n// =>  'Toyota Corolla is clearly the better choice.'\n\nchooseVehicle('Volkswagen Beetle', 'Volkswagen Golf');\n// =>  'Volkswagen Beetle is clearly the better choice.'\n```\n\n## 3. Calculate an estimation for the price of a used vehicle\n\nNow that you made your decision you want to make sure you get a fair price at the dealership.\nSince you are interested in buying a used vehicle, the price depends on how old the vehicle is.\nFor a rough estimate, assume if the vehicle is less than 3 years old, it costs 80% of the original price it had when it was brand new.\nIf it is more than 10 years old, it costs 50%.\nIf the vehicle is at least 3 years old but not older than 10 years, it costs 70% of the original price.\n\nImplement the `calculateResellPrice(originalPrice, age)` function that applies this logic using `if`, `else if` and `else` (there are other ways if you want to practice).\nIt takes the original price and the age of the vehicle as arguments and returns the estimated price in the dealership.\n\n```javascript\ncalculateResellPrice(1000, 1);\n// => 800\n\ncalculateResellPrice(1000, 5);\n// => 700\n\ncalculateResellPrice(1000, 15);\n// => 500\n```\n",
    "hints": "# Hints\n\n## 1. Determine if you will need a drivers license\n\n- Use the [strict equals operator][mdn-equality-operators] to check whether your input equals a certain string.\n- Use one of the two [logical operators][mdn-logical-operators] you learned about in the boolean concept to combine the two requirements.\n- You do **not** need an if-statement to solve this task. You can return the boolean expression you build directly.\n\n## 2. Choose between two potential vehicles to buy\n\n- Use a [relational operator][mdn-relational-operators] to determine which option comes first in dictionary order.\n- Then set the value of a helper variable depending on the outcome of that comparison with the help of an [if-else statement][mdn-if-statement].\n- Finally, construct the recommendation sentence. For that, you can use the [addition operator][mdn-addition] to concatenate the two strings.\n\n## 3. Calculate an estimation for the price of a used vehicle\n\n- Start with determining the percentage based on the age of the vehicle. Save it in a helper variable. Use an [if-else if-else statement][mdn-if-statement] as mentioned in the instructions.\n- In the two if conditions, use [relational operators][mdn-relational-operators] to compare the car's age to the threshold values.\n- To calculate the result, apply the percentage to the original price. For example, `30% of x` can be calculated by dividing `30` by `100` and multiplying with `x`.\n\n[mdn-equality-operators]: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators#equality_operators\n[mdn-logical-operators]: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators#binary_logical_operators\n[mdn-relational-operators]: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators#relational_operators\n[mdn-addition]: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Addition\n[mdn-if-statement]: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/if...else\n"
