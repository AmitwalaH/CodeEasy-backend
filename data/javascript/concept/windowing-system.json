    "introduction": "# Introduction\n\nJavaScript includes the capabilities for object-oriented programming ([OOP][wiki-oop]).\nIn OOP, you want to create objects (_instances_) from \"templates\" (_classes_) so that they include certain data and functionality.\nThe data properties are called _fields_ in the OOP context, the function properties are called _methods_.\n\nJavaScript did not have classes at all before they were added to the language specification in 2015 but allowed for object-oriented programming using prototype-based inheritance.\nAnd even though a `class` keyword is available nowadays, JavaScript is still a _prototype-based_ language.\n\nTo understand what it means to be a prototype-based language and how JavaScript actually works, we will go back to the time when there were no classes.\n\n## Prototype Syntax\n\n### Constructor Function\n\nIn JavaScript, the template (class) is facilitated by a regular function.\nWhen a function is supposed to be used as such a template, it is called a _constructor function_ and the convention is that the function name should start with a capital letter.\nInstances (objects) are derived from the template using the `new` keyword when invoking the constructor function.\n\n```javascript\nfunction Car() {\n  // ...\n}\n\nconst myCar = new Car();\nconst yourCar = new Car();\n```\n\nIt is important to note that in JavaScript, the instances and the constructor function keep a relationship to each other even after the instances were created.\nEvery instance object includes a hidden, internal property referred to as `[[prototype]]` in the language specification.\nIt holds a reference to the value of the `prototype` key of the constructor function.\nYes, you read that correctly, a JavaScript function can have key/value pairs because it is also an object behind the scenes.\n\n<!-- prettier-ignore-start -->\n~~~~exercism/note\nTo summarize:\n\n- Constructors in JavaScript are regular functions.\n- Constructing a new instance creates an object with a relation to its constructor called its _prototype_.\n- Functions are objects (callable objects) and therefore they can have properties.\n- The constructor's (function) `prototype` property will become the instance's _prototype_.\n~~~~\n<!-- prettier-ignore-end -->\n\n### Instance Fields\n\nOften, you want all the derived objects (instances) to include some fields and pass some initial values for those when the object is constructed.\nThis can be facilitated via the [`this` keyword][mdn-this].\nInside the constructor function, `this` represents the new object that will be created via `new`.\n`this` is automatically returned from the constructor function when it is called with `new`.\n\nThat means we can add fields to the new instance by adding them to `this` in the constructor function.\n\n```javascript\nfunction Car(color, weight) {\n  this.color = color;\n  this.weight = weight;\n  this.engineRunning = false;\n}\n\nconst myCar = new Car('red', '2mt');\nmyCar.color;\n// => 'red'\nmyCar.engineRunning;\n// => false\n```\n\n### Instance Methods\n\nMethods are added via the `prototype` property of the constructor function.\nInside a method, you can access the fields of the instance via `this`.\nThis works because of the following general rule.\n\n> When a function is called as a method of an object, its `this` is set to the object the method is called on. [^1]\n\n```javascript\nfunction Car() {\n  this.engineRunning = false;\n  // ...\n}\n\nCar.prototype.startEngine = function () {\n  this.engineRunning = true;\n};\n\nCar.prototype.addGas = function (litre) {\n  // ...\n};\n\nconst myCar = new Car();\nmyCar.startEngine();\nmyCar.engineRunning;\n// => true\n```\n\n### The Prototype Chain\n\n`myCar` in the example above is a regular JavaScript object and if we would inspect it (e.g. in the browser console), we would not find a property `startEngine` with a function as a value directly inside the `myCar` object.\nSo how does the code above even work then?\n\nThe secret here is called the _prototype chain_.\nWhen you try to access any property (field or method) of an object, JavaScript first checks whether the respective key can be found directly in the object itself.\nIf not, it continues to look for the key in the object referenced by the `[[prototype]]` property of the original object.\nAs mentioned before, in our example `[[prototype]]` points to the `prototype` property of the constructor function.\nThat is where JavaScript would find the `startEngine` function because we added it there.\n\n```javascript\nfunction Car() {\n  // ...\n}\n\nCar.prototype.startEngine = function () {\n  // ...\n};\n```\n\nAnd the chain does not end there.\nThe `[[prototype]]` property of `Car.prototype` (`myCar.[[prototype]].[[prototype]]`) references `Object.prototype` (the `prototype` property of the `Object` constructor function).\nIt contains general methods that are available for all JavaScript objects, e.g. `toString()`.\nIn conclusion, you can call `myCar.toString()` and that method will exist because JavaScript searches for that method throughout the whole prototype chain.\n\n<!-- prettier-ignore-start -->\n~~~~exercism/caution\nNote that the prototype chain is only travelled when retrieving a value.\nSetting a property directly or deleting a property of an instance object only targets that specific instance.\nThis might not be what you would expect when you are used to a language with class-based inheritance.\n~~~~\n<!-- prettier-ignore-end -->\n\n## Class Syntax\n\nNowadays, JavaScript supports defining classes with a `class` keyword.\nThis was added to the language specification in 2015.\nOn the one hand, this provides syntactic sugar that makes classes easier to read and write.\nThe new syntax is more similar to how classes are written in languages like C++ or Java.\nDevelopers switching over from those languages have an easier time adapting.\nOn the other hand, class syntax paves the way for new language features that are not available in the prototype syntax.\n\n### Class Declarations\n\nWith the new syntax, classes are defined with the `class` keyword, followed by the name of the class and the class body in curly brackets.\nThe body contains the definition of the constructor function, i.e. a special method with the name `constructor`.\nThis function works just like the constructor function in the prototype syntax.\nThe class body also contains all method definitions.\nThe syntax for the methods is similar to the shorthand notation we have seen for adding functions as values inside an object, see [Concept Objects][concept-objects].\n\n```javascript\nclass Car {\n  constructor(color, weight) {\n    this.color = color;\n    this.weight = weight;\n    this.engineRunning = false;\n  }\n\n  startEngine() {\n    this.engineRunning = true;\n  }\n\n  addGas(litre) {\n    // ...\n  }\n}\n\nconst myCar = new Car();\nmyCar.startEngine();\nmyCar.engineRunning;\n// => true\n```\n\nKeep in mind that behind the scenes, JavaScript is still a prototype-based language.\nAll the mechanisms we learned about in the \"Prototype Syntax\" section above still apply.\n\n### Private Fields, Getters and Setters\n\nBy default, all instance fields are public in JavaScript.\nThey can be directly accessed and assigned to.\n\nHowever, there is an established convention that fields and methods that start with an underscore should be treated as private.\nThey should never be accessed directly from outside the class.\n\nPrivate fields are sometimes accompanied by [getters][mdn-get] and [setters][mdn-set].\nWith the keywords `get` and `set` you can define functions that are executed when a property with the same name as the function is accessed or assigned to.\n\n```javascript\nclass Car {\n  constructor() {\n    this._mileage = 0;\n  }\n\n  get mileage() {\n    return this._mileage;\n  }\n\n  set mileage(value) {\n    throw new Error(`Mileage cannot be manipulated, ${value} is ignored.`);\n    // Just an example, usually you would not provide a setter in this case.\n  }\n}\n\nconst myCar = new Car();\nmyCar.mileage;\n// => 0\nmyCar.mileage = 100;\n// => Error: Mileage cannot be manipulated, 100 is ignored.\n```\n\n---\n\n[^1]: `this` Examples -

Define Size for storing the dimensions of the window\n\nDefine a class (constructor function) named `Size`.\nIt should have two fields `width` and `height` that store the window's current dimensions.\nThe constructor function should accept initial values for these fields.\nThe width is provided as the first parameter, the height as the second one.\nThe default width and height should be `80` and `60`, respectively.\n\nAdditionally, define a method `resize(newWidth, newHeight)` that takes a new width and height as parameters and changes the fields to reflect the new size.\n\n```javascript\nconst size = new Size(1080, 764);\nsize.width;\n// => 1080\nsize.height;\n// => 764\n\nsize.resize(1920, 1080);\nsize.width;\n// => 1920\nsize.height;\n// => 1080\n```\n\n## 2. Define Position to store a window position\n\nDefine a class (constructor function) named `Position` with two fields, `x` and `y` that store the current horizontal and vertical position, respectively, of the window's upper left corner.\nThe constructor function should accept initial values for these fields.\nThe value for `x` is provided as the first parameter, the value for `y` as the second one.\nThe default value should be `0` for both fields.\n\nThe position (0, 0) is the upper left corner of the screen with `x` values getting larger as you move right and `y` values getting larger as you move down.\n\nAlso define a method `move(newX, newY)` that takes new x and y parameters and changes the properties to reflect the new position.\n\n```javascript\nconst point = new Position();\npoint.x;\n// => 0\npoint.y;\n// => 0\n\npoint.move(100, 200);\npoint.x;\n// => 100\npoint.y;\n// => 200\n```\n\n## 3. Define a ProgramWindow class\n\nDefine a `ProgramWindow` class with the following fields:\n\n- `screenSize`: holds a fixed value of type `Size` with `width` 800 and `height` 600\n- `size` : holds a value of type `Size`, the initial value is the default value of the `Size` instance\n- `position` : holds a value of type `Position`, the initial value is the default value of the `Position` instance\n\nWhen the window is opened (created), it always has the default size and position in the beginning.\n\n```javascript\nconst programWindow = new ProgramWindow();\nprogramWindow.screenSize.width;\n// => 800\n\n// Similar for the other fields.\n```\n\nSide note: The name `ProgramWindow` is used instead of `Window` to differentiate the class from the built-in `Window` class that exists in browser environments.\n\n## 4. Add a method to resize the window\n\nThe `ProgramWindow` class should include a method `resize`.\nIt should accept a parameter of type `Size` as input and attempts to resize the window to the specified size.\n\nHowever, the new size cannot exceed certain bounds.\n\n- The minimum allowed height or width is 1.\n  Requested heights or widths less than 1 will be clipped to 1.\n- The maximum height and width depend on the current position of the window, the edges of the window cannot move past the edges of the screen.\n  Values larger than these bounds will be clipped to the largest size they can take.\n  E.g. if the window's position is at `x` = 400, `y` = 300 and a resize to `height` = 400, `width` = 300 is requested, then the window would be resized to `height` = 300, `width` = 300 as the screen is not large enough in the `y` direction to fully accommodate the request.\n\n```javascript\nconst programWindow = new ProgramWindow();\n\nconst newSize = new Size(600, 400);\nprogramWindow.resize(newSize);\nprogramWindow.size.width;\n// => 600\nprogramWindow.size.height;\n// => 400\n```\n\n## 5. Add a method to move the window\n\nBesides the resize functionality, the `ProgramWindow` class should also include a method `move`.\nIt should accept a parameter of type `Position` as input.\nThe `move` method is similar to `resize` however, this method adjusts the _position_ of the window to the requested value, rather than the size.\n\nAs with `resize` the new position cannot exceed certain limits.\n\n- The smallest position is 0 for both `x` and `y`.\n- The maximum position in either direction depends on the current size of the window.\n  The edges cannot move past the edges of the screen.\n  Values larger than these bounds will be clipped to the largest size they can take.\n  E.g. if the window's size is at `x` = 250, `y` = 100 and a move to `x` = 600, `y` = 200 is requested, then the window would be moved to `x` = 550, `y` = 200 as the screen is not large enough in the `x` direction to fully accommodate the request.\n\n```javascript\nconst programWindow = new ProgramWindow();\n\nconst newPosition = new Position(50, 100);\nprogramWindow.move(newPosition);\nprogramWindow.position.x;\n// => 50\nprogramWindow.position.y;\n// => 100\n```\n\n## 6. Change a program window\n\nImplement a `changeWindow` function that accepts a `ProgramWindow` instance as input and changes the window to the specified size and position.\nThe function should return the `ProgramWindow` instance that was passed in after the changes were applied.\n\nThe window should get a width of 400, a height of 300 and be positioned at x = 100, y = 150.\n\n```javascript\nconst programWindow = new ProgramWindow();\nchangeWindow(programWindow);\nprogramWindow.size.width;\n// => 400\n\n// Similar for the other fields.\n```\n",
    "hints": "# Hints\n\n## General\n\n- Revisit the [Objects Concept][concept-objects] if needed to fresh up on the basics.\n\n## 1. Define Size for storing the dimensions of the window\n\n- Remember to use [prototype syntax][mdn-prototype] for this task.\n- Start by defining a function with the name `Size` and make sure to [export][mdn-export] it.\n- The arguments passed to the constructor function need to be added to the `this` object.\n- Default values can be applied by making use of [default parameters][mdn-default-params].\n- You can add a method via the `prototype` property of the constructor function.\n\n## 2. Define Position to store a window position\n\n- Remember to use [prototype syntax][mdn-prototype] for this task.\n- Start by defining a function with the name `Position` and make sure to [export][mdn-export] it.\n- The arguments passed to the constructor function need to be added to the `this` object.\n- Default values can be applied by making use of [default parameters][mdn-default-params].\n- You can add a method via the `prototype` property of the constructor function.\n\n## 3. Define a ProgramWindow class\n\n- Remember to use [class syntax][mdn-class] for this task.\n- Make sure to [export][mdn-export] the class.\n- Define fields by adding them to the `this` object.\n- Make use of the classes you defined in the previous tasks.\n- Check that your constructor function does not accept any arguments.\n\n## 4. Add a method to resize the window\n\n- Remember to use [class syntax][mdn-class] for this task.\n  That means you add the method definition directly in the class body.\n- To find the correct values for the resizing, first think about the desired width you want to reach, taking the lower bound (`1`) into account.\n- Then calculate the maximum width that is allowed considering the screen size and current `x` position of the window.\n- With those two values, you can then decide what to apply and use an analogous logic for the height.\n- Make use of the `resize` method of the `Size` object to apply the change.\n\n## 5. Add a method to move the window\n\n- Remember to use [class syntax][mdn-class] for this task.\n  That means you add the method definition directly in the class body.\n- To find the correct values for the moving, first think about the desired `x` position you want to reach, taking the lower bound (`0`) into account.\n- Then, calculate the maximum allowed `x` value.\n  Consider the screen size and the current width of the window.\n- With those two values, you can then decide what to apply and use an analogous logic for the height.\n- Make use of the `move` method of the `Position` object to apply the change.\n\n## 6. Change a program window\n\n- First, define a `changeWindow` function and make sure to [export][mdn-export] it.\n- Create an instance of the `Size` class using the `new` keyword and provide the desired dimensions as arguments. (Similar for the needed position object.)\n- Use the methods defined in tasks 4 and 5. For example, you call a method `a` of an object `obj` with `obj.a()`.\n- Make sure to return the `Window` instance received as input.\n\n[concept-objects]: /tracks/javascript/concepts/objects\n[mdn-export]: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/export\n[mdn-default-params]: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Functions/Default_parameters\n[mdn-prototype]: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Objects/Object_prototypes#understanding_prototype_objects\n[mdn-class]: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Classes\n"
