    "introduction": "# Introduction\n\n## Numbers\n\nMany programming languages have specific numeric types to represent different types of numbers, but JavaScript only has two:\n\n- `number`: a numeric data type in the double-precision 64-bit floating-point format (IEEE 754).\n  Examples are `-6`, `-2.4`, `0`, `0.1`, `1`, `3.14`, `16.984025`, `25`, `976`, `1024.0` and `500000`.\n- `bigint`: a numeric data type that can represent _integers_ in the arbitrary precision format.\n  Examples are `-12n`, `0n`, `4n`, and `9007199254740991n`.\n\nIf you require arbitrary precision or work with extremely large numbers, use the `bigint` type.\nOtherwise, the `number` type is likely the better option.\n\n### Rounding\n\nThere is a built-in global object called `Math` that provides various [rounding functions][ref-math-object-rounding].\nFor example, you can round down (`floor`) or round up (`ceil`) decimal numbers to the nearest whole numbers.\n\n```javascript\nMath.floor(234.34); // => 234\nMath.ceil(234.34); // => 235\n```\n\n## Arithmetic Operators\n\nJavaScript provides 6 different operators to perform basic arithmetic operations on numbers.\n\n- `+`: The addition operator is used to find the sum of numbers.\n- `-`: The subtraction operator is used to find the difference between two numbers\n- `*`: The multiplication operator is used to find the product of two numbers.\n- `/`: The division operator is used to divide two numbers.\n\n```javascript\n2 - 1.5; //=> 0.5\n19 / 2; //=> 9.5\n```\n\n- `%`: The remainder operator is used to find the remainder of a division performed.\n\n  ```javascript\n  40 % 4; // => 0\n  -11 % 4; // => -3\n  ```\n\n- `**`: The exponentiation operator is used to raise a number to a power.\n\n  ```javascript\n  4 ** 3; // => 64\n  4 ** 1 / 2; // => 2\n  ```\n\n### Order of Operations\n\nWhen using multiple operators in a line, JavaScript follows an order of precedence as shown in [this precedence table][mdn-operator-precedence].\nTo simplify it to our context, JavaScript uses the PEDMAS (Parentheses, Exponents, Division/Multiplication, Addition/Subtraction) rule we've learnt in elementary math classes.\n\n<!-- prettier-ignore-start -->\n```javascript\nconst result = 3 ** 3 + 9 * 4 / (3 - 1);\n// => 3 ** 3 + 9 * 4/2\n// => 27 + 9 * 4/2\n// => 27 + 18\n// => 45\n```\n<!-- prettier-ignore-end -->\n\n### Shorthand Assignment Operators\n\nShorthand assignment operators are a shorter way of writing code conducting arithmetic operations on a variable, and assigning the new value to the same variable.\nFor example, consider two variables `x` and `y`.\nThen, `x += y` is same as `x = x + y`.\nOften, this is used with a number instead of a variable `y`.\nThe 5 other operations can also be conducted in a similar style.\n\n```javascript\nlet x = 5;\nx += 25; // x is now 30\n\nlet y = 31;\ny %= 3; // y is now 1\n```\n\n[mdn-operator-precedence]: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Operator_Precedence#table\n[ref-math-object-rounding]: https://javascript.info/number#rounding\n",
    "instructions": "# Instructions\n\nIn this exercise you will be writing code to help a freelancer communicate with their clients about the prices of certain projects.\nYou will write a few utility functions to quickly calculate the costs for the clients.\n\n```exercism/note\nThe `ratePerHour` variable and the `dayRate` function are related to money.\nThe units of measurement are money for a unit of time: hours and days respectively.\n```\n\n## 1. Calculate the day rate given an hourly rate\n\nA client contacts the freelancer to enquire about their rates.\nThe freelancer explains that they **_work 8 hours a day._**\nHowever, the freelancer knows only their hourly rates for the project.\nHelp them estimate a day rate given an hourly rate.\n\n```javascript\ndayRate(89);\n// => 712\n```\n\nThe day rate does not need to be rounded or changed to a \"fixed\" precision.\n\n## 2. Calculate the number of workdays given a fixed budget\n\nAnother day, a project manager offers the freelancer to work on a project with a fixed budget.\nGiven the fixed budget and the freelancer's hourly rate, help them calculate the number of days they would work until the budget is exhausted.\nThe result _must_ be **rounded down** to the nearest whole number.\n\n```javascript\ndaysInBudget(20000, 89);\n// => 28\n```\n\n## 3. Calculate the discounted rate for large projects\n\nOften, the freelancer's clients hire them for projects spanning over multiple months.\nIn these cases, the freelancer decides to offer a discount for every full month, and the remaining days are billed at day rate.\nYour excellent work-life balance means that you only work 22 days in each calendar month, so **_every month has 22 billable days._**\nHelp them estimate their cost for such projects, given an hourly rate, the number of billable days the project contains, and a monthly discount rate.\nThe discount is always passed as a number, where `42%` becomes `0.42`. The result _must_ be **rounded up** to the nearest whole number.\n\n```javascript\npriceWithMonthlyDiscount(89, 230, 0.42);\n// => 97972\n```\n",
    "hints": "# Hints\n\n## 1. Calculate the day rate given an hourly rate\n\n- Use the arithmetic operators as mentioned in the introduction of this exercise.\n\n## 2. Calculate the number of workdays given a budget\n\n- First determine the day rate, then calculate the number of days, and finally round that number down.\n\n## 3. Calculate the discounted rate for large projects\n\n- Round down the result from division to get the number of full months.\n- `100% - discount` equals the percentage charged after the discount is applied.\n- Use `%`, the remainder operator, to calculate the number of days exceeding full months.\n- Add the discounted month rates and full day rates and round it up\n"
