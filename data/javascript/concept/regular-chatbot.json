Hence, we can:\n\n- **Search** for a text in a string\n- **Replace** substrings in a string\n- **Extract** information from a string\n\n> 💡 JavaScript's regex flavor is part of the ECMA-262 standard for the language. This means that you don't have to worry about browser-specific compatibility.\n\n## How to create Regular Expressions\n\nIn JavaScript, a regular expressions is mostly written in the format `/pattern/modifiers`.\n\nWe have two ways of creating a regular expression:\n\n1. **Regular Expression Literal**:\n\n```javascript\nconst regex = /[a-z]/;\n```\n\n2. Constructor **RegExp**:\n\n```javascript\nconst regex = new RegExp('[a-z]');\n```\n\nIn both cases, JavaScript is creating an object out of the regex. It is recommended to use immutable patterns with the literal as default.\n\nThe RegExp constructor can be used for cases where the regex will change or we don't know it yet (like an input).\n\n## 🏴‍☠️ Flags\n\nRegular expressions have optional superpowers called [`flags`][mdn-flags] that allow for additional features.\n\nSome of the widely used are:\n\n- `/g` - Global Search\n- `/i` - Case Insensitive\n- `/m` - Multiline Search\n\nHere is a simple example:\n\n```javascript\nconst re = /home/gi;\nconst str = 'Home, sweet home.';\nconst myArray = str.match(re);\nconsole.log(myArray);\n\n=> // [\"Home\", \"home\"]\n```\n\nThe `g` character allows us to parse all possible matches within a string. Without this feature, JavaScript would have extracted only the first `Home` match.\n\nThe Case Insensitive flag `/i` enables us to be flexible when it comes to finding a pattern. This way it doesn't matter if what we are looking for is in `UPPERCASE` or `lowercase`.\n\nWhen using the `RegExp` constructor, the syntax of adding flags is different.\n\n```javascript\nlet regex = /[a-z]/gi; // literal notation\nlet regex = new RegExp('[a-z]', 'gi'); // constructor with string pattern as first argument\nlet regex = new RegExp(/[a-z]/, 'gi'); // constructor with regular expression literal as first argument (Starting with ECMAScript 6)\n```\n\n## Most common Functions\n\nWhen regular expressions are combined with current build-in functions in JavaScript, we have some powerful ways of manipulating and getting data from strings.\n\nThese are some of the most common functions used alongside regex.\n\n### Test\n\nThe [test()][mdn-regex-test] method executes a search for a match between a regular expression and a specified string. Returns true or false.\n\n```javascript\nconst str = 'It is difficult to test if you have a virus';\nconst result = /virus$/.test(str);\n\nconsole.log(result);\n\n// => true\n```\n\n### Match\n\nWith the [match()][mdn-regex-match] method, we get a useful array whose contents depend on the presence or absence of the found matches.\n\nIn this way, we are able both to **search** and to **extract** information from any string. For example:\n\n```javascript\nconst funnyQuote =\n  'If you see someone crying, ask if it is because of their haircut.';\nconst regex1 = /someone/;\nconst regex2 = /happy/;\n\nfunnyQuote.match(regex1);\n// => [\"someone\", index: 11, input: \"If you see someone crying, ask if it is because of their haircut.\", groups: undefined]\n\nfunnyQuote.match(regex2);\n// => null\n```\n\nWhen the Global Search flag `/g` is present, instead of getting the only match alongside useful information such as the index or input, the method returns all of the occurances displayed in the array:\n\n```javascript\nconst funnyQuote =\n  'If you see someone crying, ask if it is because of their haircut.';\n\nconst regex3 = /if/gi;\n\nfunnyQuote.match(regex3);\n// => [\"If\", \"if\"];\n```\n\n### Replace\n\nThe [replace()][mdn-regex-replace] method in JavaScript allows us to search for a value within a given string, and replacing it with a desired new value.\n\n```javascript\nstring.replace(searchValue, newValue);\n```\n\nThe pattern for searching the substitution can be a single string, or a regular expression.\n\n```javascript\nlet string = 'I like dogs!';\nlet result = string.replace('dogs', 'cats');\n\nlet string = 'I would love to travel to Japan';\nlet result = string.replace(/Japan/g, 'Hawaii');\n```\n\nMoreover, we can apply a function on the replacement position in order to make additional changes to each value.\n\n```javascript\nlet text = 'Say hello to the chatbot.';\nlet result = text.replace(/chatbot|hello/gi, function (word) {\n  return word.toUpperCase();\n});\n// => \"Say HELLO to the CHATBOT\"\n```\n\n### Split\n\nThe [split()][mdn-regex-split] method in JavaScript represents a different way of using and manipulating strings with regular expressions.\n\nIn this way, we will be using regex in order to divide a given string by recognizing a pattern, e.g. `str.split(/[,.\\s]/)`. This pattern will be used as the `separator`.\n\n```javascript\nconst str = 'hello,user.how are.you';\n\nconst result = str.split(/[,.\\s]/);\n\nconsole.log(result);\n// => ['hello', 'user', 'how', 'are', 'you']\n```\n\n[using-regular-expressions-in-javascript]: https://www.regular-expressions.info/javascript.html\n[mdn-regex-cheatsheet]: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Regular_Expressions/Cheatsheet\n[mdn-regular-expressions]: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Regular_Expressions\n[mdn-common-functions]: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Regular_Expressions#using_regular_expressions_in_javascript\n[mdn-flags]: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Regular_Expressions#advanced_searching_with_flags\n[mdn-regex-test]: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/RegExp/test\n[mdn-regex-match]: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String/match\n[mdn-regex-replace]: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String/replace\n[mdn-regex-split]: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String/split\n[demystifying-regular-expressions-with-javascript]: https://livecodestream.dev/post/demystifying-regular-expressions-with-javascript/\n[how-to-use-the-js-replace-method-on-a-string]: https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/javascript-regex-match-example-how-to-use-the-js-replace-method-on-a-string/\n",
    "instructions": "# Instructions\n\nYou have been hired as a Regular Expression Specialist in a company that is developing a Chatbot.\n\nIt is in a very basic phase of development, hence your mission is to use Regular Expressions to improve the chatbot's ability to understand and generate natural language.\n\n## Check Valid Command\n\nApart from being smart, the Chatbot is also a loyal assistant.\n\nTo ask something to the chatbot, the user must say the word “**Chatbot**” in the first position of the command.\n\nIt doesn't matter if the keyword is in UPPERCASE or lowercase. The important aspect here is the position of the word.\n\nImplement the function `isValidCommand()` that helps the Chatbot recognize when the user is giving a command.\n\n```javascript\nisValidCommand(\"Chatbot, play a song from the 80's.\";\n// => True\nisValidCommand(\"Hey Chatbot, where is the closest pharmacy?\";\n// => False\nisValidCommand(\"CHATBOT, do you have a solution for this challenge?\";\n// => True\n```\n\n## Remove encrypted emojis\n\nThe Chatbot has a difficult time understanding how humans use emojis to express their emotions.\n\nWhen the chatbot receives user messages, each emoji is represented as “_emoji_” followed by its _id_ number.\n\nImplement the `removeEmoji()` method to take a string and remove all the emoji’s encryption throughout the message.\n\nLines not containing emoji’s text should be returned unmodified.\n\nJust remove the emoji string. Do not attempt to adjust the whitespace.\n\nFor this particular challenge, use constructor syntax for creating the regular expression.\n\n```javascript\nremoveEmoji(\"I love playing videogames emoji3465 it's one of my hobbies\");\n// => \"I love playing videogames  it's one of my hobbies\"\n```\n\n## Check Valid Phone Number\n\nConsidering the download of chatbot features on a mobile app, the user is expected to write a phone number during the conversation.\n\nThe problem is that the chatbot can only read and validate a number with a specific format.\n\nIf the number is valid (matches the character sequence specified by the **regular expression**), the chatbot answers with a message thanking the user and confirming the number. If the number is invalid, the function informs the user that the phone number is not valid.\n\nThe expected format is: (+##) ###-###-###\n\n```javascript\ncheckPhoneNumber('(+34) 659-771-594');\n// => \"Thanks! You can now download me to your phone.\"\ncheckPhoneNumber('659-771-594');\n// => \"Oops, it seems like I can't reach out to 659-771-594\"\n```\n\n## Get website link\n\nThe Chatbot is a really curious software. Even though he can search on the internet about a particular topic, he likes to ask users about cool websites or URL’s to go find relevant information.\n\nExample of Conversation:\n\n- **Chatbot**: Hey username, I would like to learn how to code in JavaScript, do you know any cool website where I could learn?\n- **User**: I learned a lot from [exercism.org](http://exercism.org)\n\nImplement the function `getURL()` which is able to return an array with just the link of each website.\n\n```javascript\ngetURL('I learned a lot from exercism.org');\n// => [\"exercism.org\"];\n```\n\n## Greet the user\n\nFor storing data from all the persons who have had a conversation with, the chatbot is able to get the Full Name from the user’s profile in this style: **“smith, john”**.\n\nIn this way, we want our chatbot to be really polite and make a good impression.\n\nWrite the function `niceToMeetYou()` that takes a string with the full name of the user, and returns the string **“Nice to meet you, John Smith”**\n\nFor learning purposes, implement the function using a **replacement method** from Regular Expressions.\n\n```javascript\nlet str = 'Smith, John';\n\nniceToMeetYou(str);\n// => \"Nice to meet you, John Smith\"\n```\n",
    "hints": "# Hints\n\n## 1. Check Valid Command\n\n- Use the [test()][mdn-regex-test] method for returning a boolean.\n- Remember that we can use [flags][mdn-flags] at the end of the regular expression for additional features such as case insensitive.\n\n## 2. Remove Encrypted Emojis\n\n- In this case we must use the [RexExp][mdn-regular-expressions] constructor to build our regular expression.\n- Thanks to the common encryption of each emoji, we can use `[0-9]` to search for any digit after the `emoji`word.\n- The character `+` matches one or more consecutive items.\n- Use the [split()][mdn-regex-split] method alongside the regex for each emoji to get rid of all encryption.\n- Finally, return this splitted array as a string using the [join()][mdn-join] method.\n\n## 3. Check Valid Phone Number\n\n- In this exercise we are playing with `groups and ranges`. Read this [documentation][mdn-groups] for learning more about it.\n- This [article][phone-validation] is really good at explaining different ways of number validation.\n- You may also want to use this [cheatsheet][mdn-regex-cheatsheet] for a broad view of available features in regular expressions.\n- Use the `test()` method to check whether the phone number is valid or not.\n- Return the final answer with a simple `if statement`.\n\n## 4. Get Website Link\n\n- We are targeting words that are joined by one or more `.(dots)`.\n- Remember to put the flag `g` at the end so we can get all the domains in any sentence.\n- Use the [match()][mdn-regex-match] method to return an array with all the previous matches.\n\n## 5. Greet the user\n\n- First, use the [replace()][mdn-regex-replace] method directly to the given string.\n- Use [Named Capture Groups][mdn-groups] to store the `name` and `surname` into different values.\n- Pass a `(...match)` destructuring to the replacer function so you can get the name and surname into the object within the matched groups.\n- Use the `pop()` method to store the matched object with `name` and `surname`.\n- Finally, implement a `template String` so you can get the values from the regular expression object. See [this][mdn-capturing-groups] example for knowing about how match() stores objects.\n\n[mdn-regex-cheatsheet]: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Regular_Expressions/Cheatsheet\n[mdn-regular-expressions]: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Regular_Expressions\n[mdn-common-functions]: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Regular_Expressions#using_regular_expressions_in_javascript\n[mdn-flags]: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Regular_Expressions#advanced_searching_with_flags\n[mdn-regex-test]: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/RegExp/test\n[mdn-regex-match]: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String/match\n[mdn-regex-replace]: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String/replace\n[mdn-regex-split]: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String/split\n[mdn-join]: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/join\n[mdn-groups]: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Regular_Expressions/Groups_and_Ranges\n[phone-validation]: https://www.w3resource.com/javascript/form/phone-no-validation.php\n[mdn-capturing-groups]: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String/match#using_named_capturing_groups\n"
