    "introduction": "# Introduction\n\nJavaScript is a dynamic language, supporting object-oriented, imperative, and declarative (e.g. functional programming) styles.\n\n## Variables\n\nThere are a few primary ways to assign values to names in JavaScript - using variables or constants.\nOn Exercism, variables are always written in [camelCase][wiki-camel-case]; constants are written in [SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE][wiki-snake-case].\nThere is no official guide to follow, and various companies and organizations have various style guides.\n_Feel free to write variables any way you like_.\nThe upside from writing them the way the exercises are prepared is that they'll be highlighted differently in the web interface and most IDEs.\n\nVariables in JavaScript can be defined using the [`const`][mdn-const], [`let`][mdn-let] or [`var`][mdn-var] keyword.\n\nA variable can reference different values over its lifetime when using `let` or `var`.\nFor example, `myFirstVariable` can be defined and redefined many times using the assignment operator `=`:\n\n```javascript\nlet myFirstVariable = 1;\nmyFirstVariable = 'Some string';\nmyFirstVariable = new SomeComplexClass();\n```\n\nIn contrast to `let` and `var`, variables that are defined with `const` can only be assigned once.\nThis is used to define constants in JavaScript.\n\n```javascript\nconst MY_FIRST_CONSTANT = 10;\n\n// Can not be re-assigned.\nMY_FIRST_CONSTANT = 20;\n// => TypeError: Assignment to constant variable.\n```\n\n<!-- prettier-ignore -->\n~~~exercism/note\n💡 In a later Concept Exercise the difference between _constant_ assignment, _constant_ binding, and _constant_ value is explored and explained.\n~~~\n\n## Function Declarations\n\nIn JavaScript, units of functionality are encapsulated in _functions_, usually grouping functions together in the same file if they belong together.\nThese functions have parameters (so they can take arguments), and can _return_ a value using the `return` keyword.\nFunctions are invoked using `()` syntax.\n\n```javascript\nfunction add(num1, num2) {\n  return num1 + num2;\n}\n\nadd(1, 3);\n// => 4\n```\n\nIn this example, the function name is `add`.\nIt has two parameters, `num1` and `num2`.\nIt returns a value: the result of the expression `num1 + num2`\n\nThen the function `add` is _called_ using two arguments: `1` and `3`.\nThe result of the function, the returned value, is `4`.\n\n```exercism/note\n💡 In JavaScript there are _many_ different ways to declare a function.\nSome of these other ways look different than using the `function` keyword.\nThe track tries to gradually introduce them, but if you already know about them, feel free to use any of them.\nIn most cases, using one or the other isn't better or worse.\n```\n\n## Exposing to Other Files\n\nTo make a `function`, a constant, or a variable available in _other files_, they need to be [exported][mdn-export] using the `export` keyword.\nAnother file may then [import][mdn-import] these using the `import` keyword.\nThis is also known as the module system.\n\nA great example is how all the tests work.\nEach exercise has at least one file, for example `lasagna.js`, which contains the _implementation_.\nThe _implementation_ is `export`ed from the file, making it available to import in another file.\nAdditionally there is at least one other file, for example `lasagna.spec.js`, that contains the _tests_.\nThis file `import`s the public (i.e. `export`ed) entities in order to test the implementation:\n\n```javascript\n// file.js\nexport const MY_VALUE = 10;\n\nexport function add(num1, num2) {\n  return num1 + num2;\n}\n\n// file.spec.js\nimport { MY_VALUE, add } from './file';\n\nadd(MY_VALUE, 5);\n// => 15\n```\n\n[mdn-const]: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/const\n[mdn-export]: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/export\n[mdn-import]: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/import\n[mdn-let]: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/let\n[mdn-var]: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/var\n[wiki-camel-case]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camel_case\n[wiki-snake-case]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snake_case\n",
    "instructions": "# Instructions\n\nLucian's girlfriend is on her way home, and he hasn't cooked their anniversary dinner!\n\nIn this exercise, you're going to write some code to help Lucian cook an exquisite lasagna from his favorite cookbook.\n\nYou have four tasks related to the time spent cooking the lasagna.\n\n## 1. Define the expected oven time in minutes\n\nDefine the `EXPECTED_MINUTES_IN_OVEN` constant that represents how many minutes the lasagna should be in the oven. It must be exported. According to the cooking book, the expected oven time in minutes is `40`.\n\n## 2. Calculate the remaining oven time in minutes\n\nImplement the `remainingMinutesInOven` function that takes the actual minutes the lasagna has been in the oven as a _parameter_ and _returns_ how many minutes the lasagna still has to remain in the oven, based on the **expected oven time in minutes** from the previous task.\n\n```javascript\nremainingMinutesInOven(30);\n// => 10\n```\n\n## 3. Calculate the preparation time in minutes\n\nImplement the `preparationTimeInMinutes` function that takes the number of layers you added to the lasagna as a _parameter_ and _returns_ how many minutes you spent preparing the lasagna, assuming each layer takes you 2 minutes to prepare.\n\n```javascript\npreparationTimeInMinutes(2);\n// => 4\n```\n\n## 4. Calculate the total working time in minutes\n\nImplement the `totalTimeInMinutes` function that takes _two parameters_: the `numberOfLayers` parameter is the number of layers you added to the lasagna, and the `actualMinutesInOven` parameter is the number of minutes the lasagna has been in the oven. The function should _return_ how many minutes in total you've worked on cooking the lasagna, which is the sum of the preparation time in minutes, and the time in minutes the lasagna has spent in the oven at the moment.\n\n```javascript\ntotalTimeInMinutes(3, 20);\n// => 26\n```\n",
