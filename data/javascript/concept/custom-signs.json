    "introduction": "# Introduction\n\nIn JavaScript, _template strings_ allows for embedding expressions in strings, also referred to as string interpolation.\nThis functionality extends the functionality of the built-in [`String`][string-reference] global object.\n\nYou can create template strings in JavaScript by wrapping text in backticks.\nThey not only allow the text to include new lines and other special characters, but you can also embed variables and other expressions.\n\n```javascript\nconst num1 = 1;\nconst num2 = 2;\n\n`Adding ${num1} and ${num2} gives ${num1 + num2}.`;\n// => Adding 1 and 2 gives 3.\n```\n\nIn the example above, backticks - (<code>\\`\\`</code>) - are used to represent a template string. The`${...}` is the placeholder that is used for substitution.\nAny non-string types are _implicitly_ converted to strings.\nThis topic is covered in the [type conversion][type-conversion-concept] concept.\nAll types of expressions can be used with template strings.\n\n```javascript\nconst track = 'JavaScript';\n\n`This track on exercism.org is ${track.toUpperCase()}.`;\n// => This track on exercism.org is JAVASCRIPT.\n```\n\nWhen you are needing to have strings formatted on multiple lines:\n\n```javascript\n`This is an example of using template\nstrings to accomplish multiple\nlines`;\n```\n\nWith the available substitution capabilities, you can also introduce logic into the process to determine what the output string should be.\n\nAn example of this is embedding a [ternary operator][ternary-operator].\nThis operator is a short form for writing an `if/else` statement.\nThe syntax is `condition ? consequent-expression : alternative-expression`.\nIf the condition is truthy, the operand on the left-hand side of the colon will be returned.\nOtherwise, the result of the ternary expression is the operand on the right-hand side of the colon.\n\n```javascript\nconst grade = 95;\n\n`You have ${grade > 90 ? 'passed' : 'failed'} the exam.`;\n// => You have passed the exam.\n```\n\n[string-reference]: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String\n[type-conversion-concept]: /tracks/javascript/concepts/type-conversion\n[ternary-operator]: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Conditional_Operator\n",
    "instructions": "# Instructions\n\nIn this exercise you'll be writing code to help a sign company create custom messages for their signs.\n\n## 1. Build an occasion sign\n\nImplement the function `buildSign(occasion, name)` that accepts a string as the `occasion` parameter and a string holding someone's name as the `name` parameter.\nThe two parameters will be embedded into a template string to output the message on the sign.\n\n```javascript\nbuildSign('Birthday', 'Rob');\n// => \"Happy Birthday Rob!\"\n```\n\n## 2. Build a birthday sign\n\nImplement the function `buildBirthdaySign(age)` that accepts an age and based on the age will determine part of the message on the sign.\nIf the age is 50 or older, the sign will refer user as _mature_, else it will refer them as _young_.\nThe exact expected output is shown below:\n\n```javascript\nbuildBirthdaySign(50);\n// => \"Happy Birthday! What a mature fellow you are.\"\n\nbuildBirthdaySign(45);\n// => \"Happy Birthday! What a young fellow you are.\"\n```\n\n## 3. Build a graduation sign\n\nImplement the function `graduationFor(name, year)` which takes a name as a string parameter and a year as a number parameter and uses string interpolation to create a phrase for a sign that uses a newline to separate the two lines of the message.\n\n```javascript\ngraduationFor('Hannah', 2022);\n/* => \"Congratulations Hannah!\n       Class of 2022\"\n*/\n```\n\n## 4. Compute the cost of a sign\n\nImplement the function `costOf(sign, currency)` which takes a string that holds the contents of the sign and a string that represents the currency.\nThe sign has a base price of 20 in the given currency. Additionally each letter costs 2. (Whitespaces are included in the calculation.)\nThe phrase returned includes the cost to create the sign, written with two digits after the decimal point, followed by the currency string.\n\n```javascript\ncostOf('Happy Birthday Rob!', 'dollars');\n// => \"Your sign costs 58.00 dollars.\"\n```\n",
    "hints": "# Hints\n\n## 1. Build an occasion sign\n\n- [template strings][mdn-template-strings] (Template literals) allow for substitution of one or more strings and embedded expressions\n\n## 2. Build a birthday sign\n\n- [template strings][mdn-template-strings] (Template literals) allow for substitution of strings and embedded expressions\n- [ternary operator][mdn-ternary-operator] is a short-hand way of operating on conditions, similar to `if/else`. It can be easier to use in template strings because it is condensed.\n\n## 3. Build a graduation sign\n\n- [template strings][mdn-template-strings] allow strings to span onto multiple lines.\n\n## 4. Compute the cost of a sign\n\n- Figure out the [`length`][mdn-string-length] of the characters.\n- Only show the first two decimal numbers using [fixed-point][mdn-to-fixed] notation.\n\n[mdn-const]: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/const\n[mdn-template-strings]: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Template_literals\n[mdn-string-length]: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String/length\n[mdn-to-fixed]: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Number/toFixed\n[mdn-ternary-operator]: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Conditional_Operator\n"
