    "introduction": "# Introduction\n\nIn JavaScript, a [set][mdn-sets] is a list-like structure containing unique values, which can be primitives and/or object references. Unlike an array, a set's elements cannot be accessed by index.\n\nA value cannot be added to a set if it is [strictly equal][mdn-strict-equality] to any of the set's elements.\n\n```javascript\nconst set = new Set();\nconst object = { color: 'lime green' };\nconst functionallyIdenticalObject = { color: 'lime green' };\n\nset.add(object);\nset.add('wow');\nset.add(77);\n\nconsole.log(set.size);\n//=> 3\n\nset.add(functionallyIdenticalObject); // added because functionallyIdenticalObject is not strictly equal to object\nconsole.log(set.size);\n//=> 4\n\nset.add(77); // not added because 77 is strictly equal to 77\nconsole.log(set.size);\n//=> 4\n```\n\nYou can provide an array as an argument when creating a set, and the array's values will become the values of the set, also removing the duplicate values.\n\n```javascript\nconst array = [1, 5, 4, 1];\nconst set = new Set(array); // the set's values become [1, 5, 4]\n\nconsole.log(set.size);\n//=> 3\n```\n\nTo convert a set to an array, you can use [Array.from()][mdn-array-from], which converts an iterable such as a set or a map to an array.\n\n```javascript\nconst set = new Set();\n\nset.add(1);\nset.add(2);\nset.add(3);\nset.add(4);\n\nconst array = Array.from(set);\nconsole.log(array);\n//=> [1, 2, 3, 4]\n```\n\n[mdn-sets]: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Set\n[mdn-strict-equality]: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Equality_comparisons_and_sameness#strict_equality_using\n[mdn-array-from]: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/from\n",
    "instructions": "# Instructions\n\nOzan is putting together a playlist for an upcoming roadtrip. He doesn't want to hear the same track more than once, but the playlist has gotten so long that he's having trouble remembering which tracks have already been added.\n\nThe API for Ozan's music player only knows how to work with arrays, so he attempts to write some code that uses `Array.indexOf()` to check for the presence of a track before adding it to the playlist. Unfortunately, his program takes much too long to execute. He needs your help!\n\nComing to Ozan's aid, you are astonished to find that his playlist contains _half a million_ tracks. Perhaps you know of a different data structure that will allow you to manipulate the playlist more efficiently?\n\n## 1. Remove duplicate tracks\n\nImplement the `removeDuplicates` function, which takes a playlist as a _parameter_ and _returns_ a new playlist where all the tracks are unique.\n\n```javascript\nconst playlist = [\n  'Court and Spark - Joni Mitchell',\n  'Big Yellow Taxi - Joni Mitchell',\n  'Court and Spark - Joni Mitchell',\n];\n\nremoveDuplicates(playlist);\n//=> ['Court and Spark - Joni Mitchell', 'Big Yellow Taxi - Joni Mitchell']\n```\n\n## 2. Check whether a track has already been added\n\nImplement the `hasTrack` function, which takes a playlist and a track as _parameters_ and _returns_ a boolean that indicates whether the playlist contains the track.\n\n```javascript\nconst playlist = [\n  'The Fashion Show - Grace Jones',\n  'Dr. Funkenstein - Parliament',\n];\n\nhasTrack(playlist, 'Dr. Funkenstein - Parliament');\n//=> true\n\nhasTrack(playlist, 'Walking in the Rain - Grace Jones');\n//=> false\n```\n\n## 3. Add a track\n\nImplement the `addTrack` function, which takes a playlist and a track as _parameters_ and _returns_ a new playlist that includes the track.\n\n```javascript\nconst playlist = ['Selma - Bijelo Dugme'];\n\naddTrack(playlist, 'Atomic Dog - George Clinton');\n//=> ['Selma - Bijelo Dugme', 'Atomic Dog - George Clinton']\n\naddTrack(playlist, 'Selma - Bijelo Dugme');\n//=> ['Selma - Bijelo Dugme', 'Atomic Dog - George Clinton']\n```\n\n## 4. Delete a track\n\nImplement the `deleteTrack` function, which takes a playlist and a track as _parameters_ and _returns_ a new playlist that does not include the track.\n\n```javascript\nconst playlist = [\n  'The Treasure - Fra Lippo Lippi',\n  'After the Fall - Klaus Nomi',\n];\n\ndeleteTrack(playlist, 'The Treasure - Fra Lippo Lippi');\n//=> ['After the Fall - Klaus Nomi']\n\ndeleteTrack(playlist, 'I Feel the Magic - Belinda Carlisle');\n//=> ['After the Fall - Klaus Nomi']\n```\n\n## 5. List unique artists\n\nImplement the `listArtists` function, which takes a playlist as a _parameter_ and _returns_ the list of unique artists in the playlist. Note that the names of the tracks are formatted like `<SONG> - <ARTIST>`.\n\n```javascript\nconst playlist = [\n  'All Mine - Portishead',\n  'Sight to Behold - Devendra Banhart',\n  'Sour Times - Portishead',\n];\n\nlistArtists(playlist);\n//=> ['Portishead', 'Devendra Banhart']\n```\n",
    "hints": "# Hints\n\n## 1. Remove duplicate tracks\n\n- You can see an example of creating a set from an array in the [MDN docs][mdn-relation-to-arrays].\n- Make sure to convert your set back into an array before returning it.\n- Refer back to the [array destructuring concept][concept-array-destructuring] to recap how to use the spread operator.\n\n## 2. Check whether a track has already been added\n\n- There is a [built-in method][mdn-set-has] for checking whether an element is in a set.\n\n## 3. Add a track\n\n- There is a [built-in method][mdn-set-add] for adding an element to a set.\n- Make sure you're not manually calling `Set.has()` to check for the presence of the element before adding it; `Set.add()` takes care of that for you!\n\n## 4. Delete a track\n\n- There is a [built-in method][mdn-set-delete] for removing an element from a set.\n- Make sure you're not manually calling `Set.has()` to check for the presence of the element before deleting it; `Set.delete()` takes care of that for you!\n\n## 5. List unique artists\n\n- There are [a few different ways][mdn-set-iteration] to iterate over a set.\n- There is a [built-in method][mdn-string-split] for dividing a string into substrings.\n- Refer back to the [array destructuring concept][concept-array-destructuring] to recap how to skip an element when destructuring an array.\n\n[mdn-relation-to-arrays]: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Set#relation_with_array_objects\n[mdn-set-add]: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Set/add\n[mdn-set-delete]: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Set/delete\n[mdn-set-has]: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Set/has\n[mdn-set-iteration]: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Set#iterating_sets\n[mdn-string-split]: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String/split\n[concept-array-destructuring]: /tracks/javascript/concepts/array-destructuring\n"
