    "introduction": "# Introduction\n\nA _string_ is the JavaScript data type to store text data.\n\n## Creating a String\n\nYou create a string by wrapping the text in single quotes or double quotes.\nOn Exercism, single quotes are used.\n\n<!-- prettier-ignore-start -->\n```javascript\n'Hello, World!'\n\"Hello, World!\"\n```\n<!-- prettier-ignore-end -->\n\n## Strings as Lists of Characters\n\nA string can be treated as a list of characters where the first character has index `0`.\nYou can access an individual character of the string using square brackets and the index of the letter you want to retrieve.\n\n```javascript\n'cat'[1];\n// => 'a'\n```\n\nYou can determine the number of characters in a string by accessing the `length` property.\n\n```javascript\n'cat'.length;\n// => 3\n```\n\n## Concatenation and Methods\n\nThe simplest way to concatenate strings is to use the addition operator `+`.\n\n```javascript\n'I like' + ' ' + 'cats.';\n// => \"I like cats.\"\n```\n\nStrings provide a lot of helper methods, see [MDN Docs on String Methods][mdn-string-methods] for a full list.\nThe following list shows some commonly used helpers.\n\n- [`toUpperCase`][mdn-to-upper-case] and [`toLowerCase`][mdn-to-lower-case] - change the case of all characters\n- [`trim`][mdn-trim] - remove whitespace at the beginning and end\n- [`includes`][mdn-includes], [`startsWith`][mdn-starts-with] and [`endsWith`][mdn-ends-with] - determine whether another string is part of the given string\n- [`slice`][mdn-slice] - extract a section of the string\n\nStrings are immutable in JavaScript. So a \"modification\", e.g. by some of the methods above, will always create a new string instead.\n\n[mdn-string-methods]: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String#Instance_methods\n[mdn-to-upper-case]: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String/toUpperCase\n[mdn-to-lower-case]: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String/toLowerCase\n[mdn-trim]: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String/Trim\n[mdn-slice]: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String/slice\n[mdn-includes]: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String/includes\n[mdn-starts-with]: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String/startsWith\n[mdn-ends-with]: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String/endsWith\n",
    "instructions": "# Instructions\n\nA new poetry club has opened in town, and you're thinking of attending.\nBecause there have been incidents in the past, the club has a very specific door policy which you'll need to master, before attempting entry.\n\nThere are two doors at the poetry club, a front and a back door, and both are guarded.\nTo gain entry, you'll need to work out the password of the day.\n\nThe password is always based on a poem and can be derived in a two-step process.\n\n1. The guard will recite the poem, one line at a time and you have to respond with an appropriate letter of that line.\n2. The guard will now tell you all the letters you responded with at once, and you need to write them down on a piece of paper in a specific format.\n\nThe details of the process depend on which door you are trying to enter.\n\n## 1. Get the first letter of a sentence\n\nTo determine the letters for the front door password, you need to respond with the first letter of the line of the poem, that the guard recites to you.\n\nTo end up with a nice password, the members of the poetry club like to use _acrostic_ poems.\nThis means that the first letter of each sentence forms a word.\nHere is an example by one of their favorite writers Michael Lockwood.\n\n```text\nStands so high\nHuge hooves too\nImpatiently waits for\nReins and harness\nEager to leave\n```\n\nSo when the guard recites **Stands so high**, you'll respond **S**, when the guard recites **Huge hooves too**, you'll respond **H**.\n\nImplement the function `frontDoorResponse` that takes a line of the poem as an argument and returns the first letter of that line.\n\n```javascript\nfrontDoorResponse('Stands so high');\n// => \"S\"\n```\n\n## 2. Capitalize a word\n\nNow that you have all the correct letters, all you need to do to get the password for the front door is to correctly capitalize the word.\n\nImplement the function `frontDoorPassword` that accepts a string (the combined letters you found in task 1) and returns it correctly capitalized.\n\n```javascript\nfrontDoorPassword('SHIRE');\n// => \"Shire\"\n\nfrontDoorPassword('shire');\n// => \"Shire\"\n```\n\n## 3. Get the last letter of a sentence\n\nTo determine letters for the back door password, you need to respond with the last letter of the line of the poem that the guard recites to you.\n\nThe members of the poetry club are really clever.\nThe poem mentioned before is also _telestich_, which means that the last letter of each sentence also forms a word:\n\n```text\nStands so high\nHuge hooves too\nImpatiently waits for\nReins and harness\nEager to leave\n```\n\nWhen the guard recites **Stands so high**, you'll respond **h**, when the guard recites **Huge hooves too**, you'll respond **o**.\n\nNote that sometimes the guard does stylistic pauses (in the form of whitespace) at the beginning or at the end of a line.\nYou will need to ignore those pauses to derive the correct letter.\n\nImplement the function `backDoorResponse` that takes a line of the poem as an argument and returns the last letter of that line that is not a whitespace character.\n\n```javascript\nbackDoorResponse('Stands so high');\n// => \"h\"\n\nbackDoorResponse('Stands so high   ');\n// => \"h\"\n```\n\n## 4. Be polite\n\nTo enter the poetry club via the back door, you need to be extra polite.\nSo to derive the password, this time you need to correctly capitalize the word and add `', please'` at the end.\n\nImplement the function `backDoorPassword` that accepts a string (the combined letters you found in task 3) and returns the polite version of the capitalized password.\n\n```javascript\nbackDoorPassword('horse');\n// => \"Horse, please\"\n```\n",
    "hints": "# Hints\n\n## 1. Get the first letter of a sentence\n\n- Revisit the introduction to find out how to retrieve a certain letter of a string.\n- The indices start counting from 0.\n\n## 2. Capitalize a word\n\n- Capitalization means having a single _uppercase_ character, followed by _lowercase_ characters.\n- So first, you need to extract the first letter and convert it [to upper case][mdn-to-upper-case].\n- Then you need to determine the rest of the string (everything besides the first character).\n  The [slice method][mdn-slice] can help you with that.\n- After you applied the conversion [to lower case][mdn-to-lower-case], you can combine the first letter with the rest using the addition operator `+`.\n\n## 3. Get the last letter of a sentence\n\n- Revisit the introduction to find out how to retrieve a certain letter of a string.\n- The index of the last letter can be derived from the `.length` property of the string and the fact that the indices start counting at 0.\n- Strings come with a [trim][mdn-trim] method that removes leading and trailing whitespace.\n\n## 4. Be polite\n\n- Re-use an existing function to capitalize the word.\n- The addition operator `+` can be used to concatenate two strings.\n\n[mdn-to-upper-case]: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String/toUpperCase\n[mdn-to-lower-case]: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String/toLowerCase\n[mdn-slice]: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String/slice\n[mdn-trim]: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String/Trim\n"
