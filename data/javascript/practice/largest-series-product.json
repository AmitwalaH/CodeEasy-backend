    "instructions": "# Instructions\n\nYour task is to look for patterns in the long sequence of digits in the encrypted signal.\n\nThe technique you're going to use here is called the largest series product.\n\nLet's define a few terms, first.\n\n- **input**: the sequence of digits that you need to analyze\n- **series**: a sequence of adjacent digits (those that are next to each other) that is contained within the input\n- **span**: how many digits long each series is\n- **product**: what you get when you multiply numbers together\n\nLet's work through an example, with the input `\"63915\"`.\n\n- To form a series, take adjacent digits in the original input.\n- If you are working with a span of `3`, there will be three possible series:\n  - `\"639\"`\n  - `\"391\"`\n  - `\"915\"`\n- Then we need to calculate the product of each series:\n  - The product of the series `\"639\"` is 162 (`6 × 3 × 9 = 162`)\n  - The product of the series `\"391\"` is 27 (`3 × 9 × 1 = 27`)\n  - The product of the series `\"915\"` is 45 (`9 × 1 × 5 = 45`)\n- 162 is bigger than both 27 and 45, so the largest series product of `\"63915\"` is from the series `\"639\"`.\n  So the answer is **162**.\n",
