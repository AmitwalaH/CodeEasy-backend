  "about": "# About\n\nIn JavaScript, values may be of different types. Changing the type of a variable can be done by explicit _type conversion_.\nBesides that, JavaScript also performs _type coercion_ (implicit type conversion) when the context requires it.\n\n## Type Conversion\n\nJavaScript does not have a construct to cast into a (different) type like many other languages but some built-in helpers can be used instead.\nMost notably, the global objects `Boolean`, `Number` and `String` can be used as functions to convert a value to the respective type.\n\n### Converting to a Boolean (Truthy/Falsy Values)\n\nWith `Boolean(value)` you can convert any value to a boolean.\nHow does that work?\n\nThere is a fixed set of values, so called _falsy_ values, that convert to `false`.\nMost importantly, `false`, `0`, empty string, `null`, `undefined` and `NaN` are falsy.\nThe [MDN article on \"Falsy\"][mdn-falsy] shows the complete list.\n\nFor all other values, `Boolean` returns `true`.\nThese values are called _truthy_.\n\n```javascript\nBoolean(-1);\n// => true\n\nBoolean(0);\n// => false\n\nBoolean(' ');\n// => true\n\nBoolean('');\n// => false\n```\n\nNote that because of the described rules, `'0'`, `'false'`, `[]` and `{}` are **truthy** in JavaScript.\n\n### Converting to a Number\n\n`Number(value)` can be used to convert a value to a number.\nWhitespaces at the beginning and the end of a string are ignored and an empty string is converted to `0`.\nIf you try to convert a non-primitive value or a string that does not represent a number, **no** error will be thrown.\nInstead, the result is `NaN` ([Not-A-Number][mdn-nan]).\n\n```javascript\nNumber('  -12.34  ');\n// => -12.34\n\nNumber('1,2');\n// => NaN\n\nNumber('1 2');\n// => NaN\n\nNumber('');\n// => 0\n\nNumber('10e3');\n// => 10000\n\nNumber({ key: '123' });\n// => NaN\n```\n\nBelow you can see what `Number` returns for other primitive values.\n\n```javascript\nNumber(true);\n// => 1\n\nNumber(false);\n// => 0\n\nNumber(null);\n// => 0\n\nNumber(undefined);\n// => NaN\n```\n\nNote that in contrast to the last example, `Number()` called without any argument is defined to return `0`.\n\nJavaScript also provides the functions `parseInt` and `parseFloat`.\nThey apply laxer rules as to which strings can be converted to a number.\nBecause of that, `Number` should be preferred as the conversion function to avoid unexpected outcomes.\n\n```javascript\nparseInt('123a45');\n// => 123\n\nNumber('123a45');\n// => NaN\n```\n\n### Converting to a String\n\nWith `String(value)` you can convert a value to a string.\nThe result is what you would expect it to be for primitive values.\n\n```javascript\nString(12.34);\n// => '12.34'\n\nString(false);\n// => 'false'\n\nString(null);\n// => 'null'\n\nString(undefined);\n// => 'undefined'\n```\n\nFor arrays, the `String` function will apply the string conversion for each element and join the results with a comma.\nYou can also apply the [`join` method][mdn-join] yourself, e.g. to customize the separator.\nHowever, in these cases `null` and `undefined` will be converted to an empty string.\n\n```javascript\nString([42, null, true, 'abc']);\n// => '42,,true,abc'\n```\n\nFor objects, by default `String` returns an unhelpful text.\n\n```javascript\nString({ key: 'value' });\n// => '[object Object]'\n```\n\nYou can customize the conversion behavior, e.g. by providing a `toString` method.\nThe section \"[Object to primitive conversion][custom-conversion]\" on javascript.info explains the details.\n\nAnother common way to achieve a better string representation for objects and arrays is to use [JSON encoding][json].\nYou can convert into a string with `JSON.stringify` and back into an object or array with `JSON.parse`.\n\n```javascript\nconst obj = {\n  name: 'Gilda Guerra',\n  address: {\n    city: 'Goiânia',\n  },\n};\n\nJSON.stringify(obj);\n// => '{\"name\":\"Gilda Guerra\",\"address\":{\"city\":\"Goiânia\"}}'\n```\n\n## Type Coercion\n\nIn certain contexts, JavaScript will automatically convert a value to another data type before it evaluates some statement.\nThis implicit conversion is called _type coercion_.\n\n### Boolean Context\n\nWhen a value is used in a boolean context, JavaScript will apply the same rules as the `Boolean` function to implicitly convert the value.\n\n- When the condition of an [if statement][concept-conditionals] is not a boolean, coercion is applied to determine whether the condition is fulfilled or not.\n  The same applies for the first operand of the [ternary operator][mdn-ternary] `?`.\n\n  ```javascript\n  const num = 0;\n  if (num) {\n    // this block is NOT executed because 0 is falsy\n  }\n\n  const name = 'Jin';\n  name ? 'name was provided' : 'no name provided';\n  // => 'name was provided'\n  ```\n\n- The operand of the logical NOT operator `!` is also coerced into boolean before the NOT operation is applied.\n\n  ```javascript\n  const name = '';\n  !name;\n  // => true\n  ```\n\n  A result of the described behavior is that `!!value` has the same effect as `Boolean(value)`.\n  Nevertheless, you should use `Boolean` for readability.\n\n- JavaScript also applies coercion for the operands of the logical AND (`&&`) and OR (`||`) operators.\n  But keep in mind that the result of the expression is **not** necessarily a boolean.\n  It returns one of the original operands (see [MDN on Logical Operators][mdn-logical-operators]).\n\n  ```javascript\n  null || 'hello';\n  // => 'hello'\n  ```\n\n### String Context\n\nIf the addition operator `+` is used for primitive values and one operand is a string, the other one will be coerced into a string as well.\nThe conversion logic is the same as when using the `String` function.\nAfterwards, the two strings are concatenated.\n\n```javascript\nlet name;\n'hello ' + name;\n// => 'hello undefined'\n```\n\nThe same implicit conversion happens for non-string values that are embedded in [template strings][mdn-template-strings].\n\n```javascript\nconst degrees = 23;\n`It is ${degrees} °C`;\n// => 'Is is 23 °C.';\n```\n\n### Numeric Context\n\nMany operators coerce the operands into numbers (if necessary) according to the logic of the `Number` function explained above.\n\n- Arithmetic operators: `+` (if no string is involved), `-`, `*`, `/`, `%`, `**`\n- Unary plus and unary negation operators: `+`, `-`\n- Relational operators (for non-string operands): `>`, `>=`, `<`, `<=`\n- Bitwise operators: `|`, `&`, `^`, `~`\n\nRefer to the [MDN list of operators][mdn-operators] for more details about any of those operators.\n\nWhen an operand could potentially be a string, it is best to always explicitly convert with the `Number` function to avoid mistakes.\n\n```javascript\n'1' + '2';\n// => '12'\n// addition operator in string context as explained above\n\nNumber('1') + Number('2');\n// => 3\n```\n\nSometimes you will see the unary plus operator being used to coerce a string into a number.\nThis is not recommended because it is much harder to read than the explicit `Number` call.\n\n```javascript\nconst value = '42';\n+value;\n// => 42\n\nNumber(value);\n// => 42\n```\n\nUsing the loose equality and inequality operators `==`/`!=` also often involves an implicit conversion to a number.\nHowever, the exact logic of these operators is rather complicated (see [MDN on loose equality][mdn-loose-equality]).\nThe results are hard to predict and sometimes not what you would expect.\nUse the strict equality/inequality operators `===`/`!==` instead to avoid these implicit conversions.\n\n[mdn-falsy]: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Falsy\n[mdn-nan]: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/NaN\n[mdn-join]: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/join\n[custom-conversion]: https://javascript.info/object-toprimitive\n[json]: https://javascript.info/json#json-stringify\n[concept-conditionals]: /tracks/javascript/concepts/conditionals\n[mdn-logical-operators]: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Expressions_and_Operators#logical_operators\n[mdn-ternary]: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Conditional_Operator\n[mdn-template-strings]: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Template_literals\n[mdn-operators]: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators\n[mdn-loose-equality]: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Equality_comparisons_and_sameness#loose_equality_using_\n",
