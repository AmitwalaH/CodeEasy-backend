  "about": "# About\n\n## General Syntax\n\nA common way to conditionally execute logic in JavaScript is the if-statement.\nIt consists of the `if` keyword, a condition wrapped in round brackets and a code block wrapped in curly brackets.\nThe code block will only be executed if the condition evaluates to `true`.\n\n```javascript\nif (condition) {\n  // code that is executed if \"condition\" is true\n}\n```\n\nIt can be used stand-alone or combined with the `else` keyword.\n\n```javascript\nif (condition) {\n  // code that is executed if \"condition\" is true\n} else {\n  // code that is executed otherwise\n}\n```\n\n## Nested If-Statements\n\nTo nest another condition into the `else` statement you can use `else if`.\nNote that there is no `elseif` keyword in JavaScript.\nInstead, write `else` followed by another `if` statement.\n\n```javascript\nif (condition1) {\n  // code that is executed if \"condition1\" is true\n} else if (condition2) {\n  // code that is executed if \"condition2\" is true\n  // but \"condition1\" was false\n} else {\n  // code that is executed otherwise\n}\n```\n\nTheoretically, you can nest as many additional conditions as you want.\nIn practice you would use a [`switch` statement](/tracks/javascript/concepts/conditionals-switch) instead in these cases.\n\n```javascript\nif (condition1) {\n  // ...\n} else if (condition2) {\n  // ...\n} else if (condition3) {\n  // ...\n} else if (condition4) {\n  // ...\n} else {\n  // ...\n}\n```\n\n## Condition\n\nWhen constructing complex conditions, refer to the [operator precedence table][mdn-operator-precedence] to avoid unnecessary brackets.\n\n```javascript\nif (num >= 0 && num < 1) {\n  // ...\n}\n\n// The inner brackets are obsolete because relational operators\n// have higher precedence than logical operators.\n<!-- prettier-ignore-start -->\n\nif ((num >= 0) && (num < 1)) {\n  // ...\n}\n<!-- prettier-ignore-end -->\n\n```\n\nAlso, consider using additional variables to make the code more readable.\n\n```javascript\nconst isPositive = num >= 0;\nconst isSmall = num < 1;\nif (isPositive && isSmall) {\n  // ...\n}\n```\n\nIn JavaScript, the condition does not have to be of type boolean.\nIf any other type than boolean is provided in a boolean context like the if-statement, JavaScript will implicitly convert the value to boolean.\nRefer to the [type conversion concept][concept-type-conversion] for details on which values are _truthy_ and _falsy_, respectively.\n\n```javascript\nconst num = 4;\nif (num) {\n  // this code block will be executed because 4 is truthy\n}\n```\n\n## Short-Hand Notations\n\nIf you only want to execute one statement in the code block for `if` or `else`, it is possible in JavaScript to omit the curly brackets.\n\n<!-- prettier-ignore-start -->\n```javascript\nif (condition) doSomething();\n\n// or\n\nif (condition)\n  doSomething();\n```\n<!-- prettier-ignore-end -->\n\nThis is sometimes used when checking for an error condition for example.\nIn general, it is not recommended because it is easy to forget to add the brackets back in when adding a second statement that should depend on the same condition.\n\nWhen writing functions, it is a common pattern to omit the `else` block and use an early `return` in the `if` block instead.\nIn many cases, this reduces _nesting_ and makes the code more readable and easier to follow.\n\n```javascript\nfunction checkNumber(num) {\n  let message = '';\n\n  if (num === 0) {\n    message = 'You passed 0, please provide another number.';\n  } else {\n    message = 'Thanks for passing such a nice number.';\n  }\n\n  return message;\n}\n\n// Can also be written as ...\nfunction checkNumber(num) {\n  if (num === 0) {\n    return 'You passed 0, please provide another number.';\n  }\n\n  return 'Thanks for passing such a nice number.';\n}\n```\n\n[concept-type-conversion]: /tracks/javascript/concepts/type-conversion\n[mdn-operator-precedence]: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Operator_Precedence#table\n",
