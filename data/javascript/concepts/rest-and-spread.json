  "about": "# About\n\nJavaScript has a built-in `...` operator that makes it easier to work with indefinite numbers of elements. Depending on the context, it's called either a _rest operator_ or _spread operator_.\n\n## Rest operator\n\n### Rest elements\n\nWhen `...` appears on the left-hand side of an assignment, those three dots are known as the `rest` operator. The three dots together with a variable name is called a rest element. It collects zero or more values, and stores them into a single array.\n\n```javascript\nconst [a, b, ...everythingElse] = [0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8];\n\na;\n// => 0\nb;\n// => 1\neverythingElse;\n// => [1, 2, 3, 5, 8]\n```\n\nNote that in JavaScript, unlike some other languages, a `rest` element cannot have a trailing comma. It _must_ be the last element in a destructuring assignment. The example below throws a `SyntaxError`:\n\n```javascript\nconst [...items, last] = [2, 4, 8, 16]\n```\n\n### Rest properties\n\nSimilarly to arrays, the rest operator can also be used to collect one or more object properties and store them in a single object.\n\n```javascript\nconst { street, ...address } = {\n  street: 'Platz der Republik 1',\n  postalCode: '11011',\n  city: 'Berlin',\n};\n\nstreet;\n// => 'Platz der Republik 1'\n\naddress;\n// => {postalCode: '11011', city: 'Berlin'}\n```\n\n## Rest parameters\n\nWhen `...` appears in a function definition next to its last argument, that parameter is called a _rest parameter_. It allows the function to accept an indefinite number of arguments as an array.\n\n```javascript\nfunction concat(...strings) {\n  return strings.join(' ');\n}\n\nconcat('one');\n// => 'one'\n\nconcat('one', 'two', 'three');\n// => 'one two three'\n```\n\n## Spread\n\n### Spread elements\n\nWhen `...` appears on the right-hand side of an assignment, it's known as the `spread` operator. It expands an array into a list of elements. Unlike the rest element, it can appear anywhere in an array literal expression, and there can be more than one.\n\n```javascript\nconst oneToFive = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];\nconst oneToTen = [...oneToFive, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10];\n\noneToTen;\n// => [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]\nconst woow = ['A', ...oneToFive, 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E', ...oneToFive, 42];\n\nwoow;\n// =>  [\"A\", 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, \"B\", \"C\", \"D\", \"E\", 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 42]\n```\n\n### Spread properties\n\nSimilarly to arrays, the spread operator can also be used to copy properties from one object to another.\n\n```javascript\nlet address = {\n  postalCode: '11011',\n  city: 'Berlin',\n};\n\naddress = { ...address, country: 'Germany' };\n// => {\n//   postalCode: '11011',\n//   city: 'Berlin',\n//   country: 'Germany',\n// }\n```\n",
