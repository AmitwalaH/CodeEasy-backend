  "about": "# About\n\nInheritance is a way to create parent-child relationships between classes.\nThe child class (sometimes referred to as a _subclass_) has access to the behavior and data defined by the parent class (sometimes referred to as a _superclass_).\n\n```javascript\nclass Pet {\n  constructor(name) {\n    this.name = name;\n  }\n\n  introduce() {\n    console.log(`This is my pet, ${this.name}.`);\n  }\n}\n\nclass Dog extends Pet {}\n\nconst dog = new Dog('Otis');\ndog.introduce();\n// => This is my pet, Otis.\n```\n\nThe `extends` keyword in the child class declaration establishes a relationship with the parent class through the [prototype chain][prototype-chain].\n\nObjects created by the child's constructor will have the parent class's prototype in their prototype chain, providing access to any methods or data defined by the parent.\n\n```javascript\nconst dog = new Dog('Otis');\n\nDog.prototype.isPrototypeOf(dog); // => true\nPet.prototype.isPrototypeOf(dog); // => true\nPet.prototype.isPrototypeOf(Dog.prototype); // => true\n\nPet.prototype.hasOwnProperty('introduce'); // => true\nDog.prototype.hasOwnProperty('introduce'); // => false\ndog.hasOwnProperty('introduce'); // => false\n```\n\n## Constructors\n\nIf no constructor function is defined by the child class, the parent constructor function is used.\nHowever, if the child class defines a constructor function of its own, the parent constructor must be explicitly called.\nTo invoke the parent constructor from within the child constructor's scope, the keyword `super` is used.\n\n```javascript\nclass Pet {\n  constructor(name) {\n    this.name = name;\n  }\n}\n\nclass Dog extends Pet {\n  constructor(name, breed) {\n    super(name);\n    this.breed = breed;\n  }\n}\n\nconst dog = new Dog('Otis', 'Pug');\n```\n\nBecause the parent constructor is responsible for initializing a new object and assigning it to `this`, it must be called before `this` is used by the child constructor.\n\n```javascript\nclass Dog extends Pet {\n  constructor(name, breed) {\n    // using 'this' before calling the parent constructor with 'super'\n    this.breed = breed;\n    super(name);\n  }\n}\n\nconst dog = new Dog('Otis', 'Pug');\n// => ReferenceError: Must call super constructor in derived class before accessing 'this'...\n```\n\n## Defining Methods on the Child Class\n\nA child class may define behavior of its own in addition to the behavior inherited from the parent.\n\nThis is one of the key reasons for using inheritance; to have specialized child classes with their own unique data and methods that are related through shared methods and data supplied by the parent class.\n\n```javascript\nclass Dog extends Pet {\n  constructor(name, breed) {\n    super(name);\n    this.breed = breed;\n  }\n\n  describe() {\n    console.log(`${this.name} is a ${this.breed}.`);\n  }\n}\n\nconst dog = new Dog('Otis', 'Pug');\ndog.introduce();\ndog.describe();\n// => 'This is my pet, Otis.'\n// => 'Otis is a Pug.'\n```\n\n## Overriding Methods Inherited From the Parent Class\n\nA child class can also override the behavior of a method defined by the parent and replace or extend it with behavior defined by the child class.\n\n```javascript\nclass Cat extends Pet {\n  // replacing parent class behavior\n  introduce() {\n    console.log(`This is my cat, ${this.name}.`);\n  }\n}\n\nclass Dog extends Pet {\n  constructor(name, breed) {\n    super(name);\n    this.breed = breed;\n  }\n\n  describe() {\n    console.log(`${this.name} is a ${this.breed}.`);\n  }\n\n  // extending parent class behavior\n  introduce() {\n    super.introduce();\n    this.describe();\n  }\n}\n\nconst cat = new Cat('Milo');\ncat.introduce();\n// => 'This is my cat, Milo.'\n\nconst dog = new Dog('Otis', 'Pug');\ndog.introduce();\n// => This is my pet, Otis.\n// => Otis is a Pug.\n```\n\nTo call a method defined on the parent class from the body of a method with the same name on the child class, the keyword `super` must be used to reference the parent.\n\n[prototype-chain]: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Inheritance_and_the_prototype_chain\n",
