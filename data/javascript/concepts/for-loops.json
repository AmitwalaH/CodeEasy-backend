  "about": "# About\n\n## General Syntax\n\nThe for loop is one of the most commonly used statements to repeatedly execute some logic.\nIn JavaScript, it consists of the `for` keyword, a _header_ wrapped in round brackets and a code block that contains the _body_ of the loop wrapped in curly brackets.\n\n```javascript\nfor (initialization; condition; step) {\n  // code that is executed repeatedly as long as the condition is\n  // true\n}\n```\n\n## Header\n\nThe initialization usually sets up a counter variable, the condition checks whether the loop should be continued or stopped and the step increments the counter at the end of each repetition.\nThe individual parts of the header are separated by semicolons.\n\n```javascript\nconst list = ['a', 'b', 'c'];\nfor (let i = 0; i < list.length; i++) {\n  // code that should be executed for each item in the array\n}\n```\n\nAll three parts of the header are optional.\nThis is rarely utilized in practice.\nYou can read more about this in the [MDN documentation][mdn-optional-header-parts].\n\n## Nested For Loops\n\nFor loops can be nested, for example to iterate over nested (multi-dimensional) [arrays][concept-arrays].\nMake sure to set up a different counter variable for each loop.\n\n```javascript\nconst coords = [\n  [1, 2],\n  [4, 7],\n  [10, -3],\n];\n\nfor (let i = 0; i < coords.length; i++) {\n  for (let j = 0; j < coords[i].length; j++) {\n    // do something with coords[i][j]\n  }\n}\n```\n\n## Break, Continue and Labels\n\nInside a loop body, you can use the `break` keyword to stop the execution of the loop entirely.\nIn contrast, the keyword `continue` only stops the execution of the current iteration and continues with the next one.\n\nWhen working with nested loops, `break` and `continue` always apply to the innermost loop by default.\nYou can use labels to change that behavior.\nA label is an identifier name followed by a colon.\nIt is placed in front of (or above) the loop.\nSuch a label can then be combined with `break` or `continue` to define to which loop the statement should apply.\n\n```javascript\nouter: for (let i = 0; i < 10; i++) {\n  for (let j = 0; j < 10; j++) {\n    // ...\n    if (j > 5) {\n      continue outer;\n    }\n    // ...\n  }\n}\n```\n\n## Loop Counter and Asynchronous Code\n\nYou need to be careful to correctly declare your counter variable when dealing with [asynchronous code][mdn-concept-asynchronous].\nLet us look at an example where we sum up the counter variable asynchronously with `setTimeout` after waiting for 1s.\nWhen declaring the counter with `var` or with `let` but outside the header, the code does not yield the expected result.\n\n<!-- prettier-ignore-start -->\n```javascript\nlet sum = 0;\nfor (var i = 1; i < 4; i++) {\n  setTimeout(function () { sum += i; }, 1000);\n}\n// eventually sum will be 12 instead of 6 (1+2+3)\n```\n<!-- prettier-ignore-end -->\n\n<!-- prettier-ignore-start -->\n```javascript\nlet sum = 0;\nlet i;\nfor (i = 1; i < 4; i++) {\n  setTimeout(function () { sum += i; }, 1000);\n}\n// same here, eventually sum will be 12 instead of 6 (1+2+3)\n```\n<!-- prettier-ignore-end -->\n\nIn these two cases `i` is not scoped to one specific loop iteration.\nBy the time the sum is calculated, `i` already reached its final value `4` which leads to the sum being `4 + 4 + 4 = 12`.\n\nThis problem can be avoided by declaring the counter with `let` inside the header.\nThis has the special effect that each iteration gets its very own variable `let i` that is scoped to exactly that one execution of the loop body.\nSo when the sum is calculated later, each [callback][concept-callbacks] function refers to their own variable `i` that still holds the correct value.\n\n<!-- prettier-ignore-start -->\n```javascript\nlet sum = 0;\nfor (let i = 1; i < 4; i++) {\n  setTimeout(function () { sum += i; }, 1000);\n}\n// eventually sum will be 6 (1+2+3) as expected\n```\n<!-- prettier-ignore-end -->\n\n[mdn-optional-header-parts]: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/for#optional_for_expressions\n[concept-arrays]: /tracks/javascript/concepts/arrays\n[concept-callbacks]: /tracks/javascript/concepts/callbacks\n[mdn-concept-asynchronous]: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Asynchronous/Concepts\n",
