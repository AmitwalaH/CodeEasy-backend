  "about": "# About\n\nIn contrast to many other languages, there are two different entities in JavaScript that represent the absence of a (meaningful) value.\nThere is `null` and `undefined`.\n\n## Null\n\nThe primitive value `null` is used as an intentional \"empty value\" for a variable.\nIn other languages, a similar construct might be used only for (missing) objects or pointer types.\nIn JavaScript `null` generally represents an empty value for any type.\n\n```javascript\nlet name = null;\n// name is intentionally set to \"empty\" because it is not\n// available\n```\n\nYou can check whether a variable is null by using the [strict equality operator][mdn-strict-equality] `===`.\nAlthough `null` is a primitive value, the [`typeof` operator][mdn-typeof] \"wrongly\" returns `object` for [historic reasons][mdn-typeof-null].\nThat means it cannot be used by itself to check whether a variable is null.\n\n```javascript\nlet name = null;\n\nname === null;\n// => true\n\n// Pitfall:\ntypeof name;\n// => 'object'\n```\n\n## Undefined\n\n> A variable that has not been assigned a value is of type `undefined`.<sup>1</sup>\n\nThat means while `null` represents an empty value (but still a value), `undefined` represents the total absence of a value. 🤯\n\n`undefined` appears in different contexts.\n\n- If a variable is declared without a value (initialization), it is `undefined`.\n- If you try to access a value for a non-existing key in an object, you get `undefined`.\n- If a function does not return a value, the result is `undefined`.\n- If an argument is not passed to a function, it is `undefined`, unless that argument has a default value.\n\n```javascript\nlet name;\nconsole.log(name);\n// => undefined\n\nlet obj = { greeting: 'hello world' };\nconsole.log(obj.missingKey);\n// => undefined\n\nfunction returnNothing() {\n  return;\n}\nconsole.log(returnNothing());\n// => undefined\n```\n\nYou can check whether a variable is undefined using the strict equality operator `===` or the `typeof` operator.\n\n```javascript\nlet name;\n\nname === undefined;\n// => true\n\ntypeof name === 'undefined';\n// => true\n```\n\nIt is not recommended to manually assign `undefined` to a variable, always use `null` instead to make it clear you set an empty value intentionally.\n\n## Optional Chaining\n\nAs mentioned above, accessing a non-existent key in an object returns `undefined` in JavaScript.\nHowever, if you try to retrieve a nested value and the parent key does not exist, the evaluation of the nested key is performed on `undefined` and leads to `TypeError: Cannot read property ... of undefined`.\nTheoretically, you would always need to check the parent key exists before you can try to retrieve the nested key.\nThis was often done with the AND operator `&&` but for deeply nested values this leads to very lengthy expressions.\n\n```javascript\nobj.level1 && obj.level1.level2 && obj.level1.level2.level3;\n```\n\nTo solve this problem, [optional chaining][mdn-optional-chaining] was added to the language specification in 2020.\nWith the optional chaining operator `?.` you can ensure that JavaScript only tries to access the nested key if the parent was not `null` or `undefined`.\nOtherwise `undefined` is returned.\n\n```javascript\nconst obj = {\n  address: {\n    street: 'Trincomalee Highway',\n    city: 'Batticaloa',\n  },\n};\n\nobj.residence;\n// => undefined\n\nobj.address.zipCode;\n// => undefined\n\nobj.residence.street;\n// => TypeError: Cannot read property 'street' of undefined\n\nobj.residence?.street;\n// => undefined\n\nobj.residence?.street?.number;\n// => undefined\n```\n\n## Nullish Coalescing\n\nThere are situations where you want to apply a default value in case a variable is null or undefined.\nIn the past this was often done with a ternary operator `?` or by utilizing lazy evaluation of the OR operator `||`.\nThis has the disadvantage that the default value is applied in all cases where the variable is [falsy][mdn-falsy] (e.g. `''` or `0`), not only when it is null or undefined.\nThis can easily cause unexpected outcomes.\n\n```javascript\nlet amount = null;\namount = amount || 1;\n// => 1\n\namount = 0;\namount = amount || 1;\n// => 1\n\namount = 0;\namount ? amount : 1;\n// => 1\n```\n\nTo address this, the [nullish coalescing operator][mdn-nullish-coalescing] `??` was introduced.\nJust like optional chaining, it was added to the language specification in 2020.\nThe nullish coalescing operator `??` returns the right-hand side operand only when the left-hand side operand is `null` or `undefined`.\nOtherwise, the left-hand side operand is returned.\nWith that, a default value can now be applied more specifically.\n\n```javascript\nlet amount = null;\namount = amount ?? 1;\n// => 1\n\namount = 0;\namount = amount ?? 1;\n// => 0\n```\n\n---\n\n[1] Undefined, MDN.
