  "about": "# About\n\nErrors are useful to report when something is wrong or unexpected in a program or a piece of code.\n\nThey are javascript objects.\n\nThe main property of this object is `message`:\n\n```javascript\nconst error = new Error('Oops, something went wrong');\n\nconsole.log(error.message);\n// => \"Oops, something went wrong\"\n```\n\nUsing the `throw` syntax, you can throw an Error.\n\n```javascript\nthrow new Error('Oops');\n```\n\nWhen an error is thrown, the current execution is stopped and resumes in the first catch block of the call stack.\n\n```javascript\ntry {\n  throw new Error('Oops');\n} catch (error) {\n  console.log(error.message);\n  // => \"Oops\"\n}\n```\n\nAs with any class in JavaScript, subclasses can inherit from `Error` to create Custom errors by using the `extends` keyword.\nThe `instanceof` syntax will check if the error caught is an instance of a particular subclass of `Error`.\n\n```javascript\nclass CustomError extends Error {}\n\ntry {\n  // ... Code that may throw an error\n} catch (error) {\n  if (error instanceof CustomError) {\n    console.log('The error thrown is an instance of the CustomError');\n  }\n}\n```\n\n## Error Types\n\nIn addition to the `Error` object, other built-in error objects exist. You can learn more about it [here][error-types]\n\n## Custom Errors\n\nYou can also define your own [Custom error Type][custom-error-type] by creating a class that extends one of the built-ins Error Types\n\n```javascript\nclass MyCustomError extends Error {}\n```\n\n## Throwing non-errors\n\nWhile the syntax `throw` is usually used to throw an Error object, JavaScript is flexible and will let you throw a `string`, a `null` or any primitive type.\n\n## Error stacktraces\n\nWhile this is not standard in JavaScript, most of the JavaScript environments implement a [`stack`][error-stack] property on the Error objects, allowing you to get the stack trace of the error that was thrown.\n\n[error-types]: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Error#error_types\n[custom-error-type]: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Error#custom_error_types\n[error-stack]: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Error/Stack\n",
