  "about": "# About\n\n## Explanation\n\nBesides primitive data types like `number` and `string`, there is another important data type in JavaScript called `object`.\nObjects are collections of key-value pairs.\nAs such, they can be used as what is often referred to as maps or dictionaries in other languages.\n\nIn other languages, all values in a map often need to have the same data type.\nIn JavaScript, only the type of the key is restricted: it has to be a string.\nThe values inside one object can have different types.\nThey can be primitive types like numbers but also arrays, other objects or even functions.\nThis makes objects very versatile so that they are also key entities for [object-oriented programming][oop] (OOP) in JavaScript.\n\nIn the following, we will focus on objects as collections or maps. Other use cases of objects will be covered in other concepts, see e.g., [Classes][classes].\n\n## Creating an Object\n\nYou create an object [literal][literal] using curly brackets.\nYou can also directly include some entries (key-value pairs).\nFor that, state the key first, followed by a colon and the value.\n\n```javascript\nconst emptyObject = {};\n\nconst obj = {\n  favoriteNumber: 42,\n  greeting: 'Hello World',\n  useGreeting: true,\n  address: {\n    street: 'Trincomalee Highway',\n    city: 'Batticaloa',\n  },\n  fruits: ['melon', 'papaya'],\n  addNumbers: function (a, b) {\n    return a + b;\n  },\n};\n```\n\nThe trailing comma after the last entry is optional in JavaScript.\nYou can read about the advantages of using it [here][mdn-trailing-commas].\n\nYou might wonder why the keys are not wrapped in quotation marks although they are supposed to be strings.\nThis is a short-hand notation.\nIf the key follows the naming rules for a JavaScript [identifier][mdn-identifier], you can omit the quotation marks.\nFor keys with special characters in the name, you need to apply the usual string notation.\n\n```javascript\nconst obj = {\n  '1keyStartsWithNumber': '...',\n  'key/with/slashes': '...',\n  'key-with-dashes': '...',\n  'key with spaces': '...',\n  '#&()[]{}èä樹keyWithSpecialChars': '...',\n};\n```\n\nOften you will want to add existing variables when declaring an object.\nThis would often lead to key-value pairs like `name: name`.\nJavaScript has a short-hand notation that allows just writing `name` instead.\nThere is also a short-hand notation for defining a function in an object.\nThere you can omit the colon and the `function` keyword.\n\n```javascript\nconst x = 1;\nconst y = 2;\n\nconst obj = {\n  x: x,\n  y: y,\n  calcSum: function (a, b) {\n    return a + b;\n  },\n};\n\n// Can be shortened to ...\nconst obj = {\n  x,\n  y,\n  calcSum(a, b) {\n    return a + b;\n  },\n};\n```\n\nIf you want to create an object literal with a key name that is stored in a variable or derived via an expression, you need to wrap the variable or expression in square brackets.\n\n```javascript\nconst key = 'greeting';\n\nconst obj = {\n  [key]: 'hello world',\n};\nconsole.log(obj);\n// => { greeting: 'hello world' }\n```\n\n## Retrieving a Value\n\nThere are two ways to retrieve the value for a given key, dot notation and bracket notation.\n\n```javascript\nconst obj = { greeting: 'hello world' };\n\nobj.greeting;\n// => hello world\n\nobj['greeting'];\n// => hello world\n\n// Bracket notation also works with variables.\nconst key = 'greeting';\nobj[key];\n// => hello world\n```\n\nUsing the dot notation as a shorthand has the same restriction as omitting the quotation marks.\nIt only works if the key follows the identifier naming rules.\n\nIf you try to retrieve a key that does not exist in the object, JavaScript returns `undefined`.\nSee [Null and Undefined][concept-null-undefined] for more details on this.\n\nYou can chain the keys if you want to retrieve a value from a nested object.\n\n```javascript\nconst obj = {\n  address: {\n    street: 'Trincomalee Highway',\n    city: 'Batticaloa',\n  },\n};\n\nobj.address.city;\n// => 'Batticaloa'\n\nobj['address']['city'];\n// => 'Batticaloa'\n\n// Notations can also be mixed.\nobj.address['city'];\n// => 'Batticaloa'\n```\n\n## Adding or Changing a Value\n\nYou can add or change a value using the assignment operator `=`.\nAgain, there are dot and bracket notations available.\n\n```javascript\nconst obj = { greeting: 'hello world' };\n\nobj.greeting = 'Hi there!';\nobj['greeting'] = 'Welcome.';\n\nobj.newKey1 = 'new value 1';\nobj['new key 2'] = 'new value 2';\n\nconst key = 'new key 3';\nobj[key] = 'new value 3';\n```\n\n## Deleting an Entry\n\nYou can delete a key-value pair from an object using the `delete` keyword.\n\n```javascript\nconst obj = {\n  key1: 'value1',\n  key2: 'value2',\n};\n\ndelete obj.key1;\ndelete obj['key2'];\n```\n\nNote that although `undefined` is returned for non-existing keys, setting a key to `undefined` does not remove the entry.\nAlways use `delete` instead.\n\n## Checking Whether a Key Exists\n\nYou can check whether a certain key exists in an object with the `hasOwnProperty` method.\n\n```javascript\nconst obj = { greeting: 'hello world' };\n\nobj.hasOwnProperty('greeting');\n// => true\n\nobj.hasOwnProperty('age');\n// => false\n```\n\n`hasOwnProperty` returns `false` for [inherited keys][concept-inheritance]. This is usually the desired behavior.\nIf you want to include inherited keys in the existence check you can use the [`in` operator][mdn-in-operator] instead.\n\n## Looping Through an Object\n\nThere is a special `for...in` loop to iterate over all keys of an object.\n\n```javascript\nconst obj = {\n  name: 'Ali',\n  age: 65,\n};\n\nfor (let key in obj) {\n  console.log(key, obj[key]);\n}\n// name Ali\n// age 65\n```\n\nIt might seem like `for...in` always visits the keys in the order in which they appear or were added to the object (insertion order).\nNevertheless, you should not rely on this because there are special cases where the order will differ from the insertion order.\nAlways write your code as if the order would be arbitrary.\nIf you need a reliable order, use a [`Map`][jsinfo-map] or a nested [array][concept-arrays] instead of an object.\n\nThe `for…in` loop has a pitfall in case the object has [inherited keys][concept-inheritance].\nThose will also be visited by the `for…in` loop.\nYou usually want to avoid this so you need to skip over them like shown below.\n\n```javascript\nfor (let key in obj) {\n  if (!obj.hasOwnProperty(key)) {\n    continue;\n  }\n  // ...\n}\n```\n\nJavaScript also has a `for...of` loop, for example to iterate over arrays.\nIt is important to note that `for...in` and `for...of` are not interchangeable, see [MDN documentation][mdn-for-in-for-of] for details on this.\n\n## Keys, Values and Entries\n\nThe built-in object `Object` provides helper methods to retrieve all the keys, values or entries of a given object as arrays.\n\n```javascript\nconst obj = {\n  name: 'Ali',\n  age: 65,\n};\n\nObject.keys(obj);\n// => [ 'name', 'age' ]\n\nObject.values(obj);\n// => [ 'Ali', 65 ]\n\nObject.entries(obj);\n// => [ [ 'name', 'Ali' ], [ 'age', 65 ] ]\n```\n\n## Truly Empty Object\n\nYou might have noticed that an empty object in JavaScript is not completely empty.\nFor example, it contains the `hasOwnProperty` method and other methods like `toString`.\nUsually, that does not cause any problems but if you ever need to create a truly empty object use a [null object][mdn-null-object] that can be created via `Object.create(null)`.\n\n[oop]: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Objects/Object-oriented_JS\n[classes]: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Classes\n[literal]: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Grammar_and_types#literals\n[mdn-trailing-commas]: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Trailing_commas\n[mdn-identifier]: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Identifier\n[jsinfo-map]: https://javascript.info/map-set#map\n[concept-inheritance]: /tracks/javascript/concepts/inheritance\n[mdn-in-operator]: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/in\n[mdn-null-object]: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/create#custom_and_null_objects\n[mdn-for-in-for-of]: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/for...of#difference_between_for...of_and_for...in\n[concept-null-undefined]: /tracks/javascript/concepts/null-undefined\n",
