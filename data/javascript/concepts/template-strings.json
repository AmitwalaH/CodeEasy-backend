The`${...}` is the placeholder that is used for substitution.\nAny non-string types are _implicitly_ converted to strings.\nThis topic is covered in the [type conversion][type-conversion-concept] concept.\nAll types of expressions can be used with template strings.\n\n```javascript\nconst track = 'JavaScript';\n\n`This track on exercism.org is ${track.toUpperCase()}.`;\n// => This track on exercism.org is JAVASCRIPT.\n```\n\nWhen you are needing to have strings formatted on multiple lines:\n\n```javascript\n`This is an example of using template\nstrings to accomplish multiple\nlines`;\n```\n\nWith the available substitution capabilities, you can also introduce logic into the process to determine what the output string should be.\nOne way to handle the logic could be using the [ternary operator][ternary-operator].\nThis gives the same conditional `if/else` functionality in a slightly different format.\n\nTo implement logic into template string syntax:\n\n```javascript\nconst grade = 95;\n\n`You have ${grade > 90 ?
