  "about": "# About\n\nIn JavaScript, a set is a list-like data structure that can only contain unique primitives and/or object references.\n\nSets must be created using the set constructor; they can be initialized with values by passing an array to the constructor.\n\n```javascript\nconst emptySet = new Set();\nconst setWithInitialValues = new Set(['hello', 'world']);\n```\n\n## Adding and removing elements\n\nA value cannot be added to a set if it is [strictly equal][mdn-strict-equality] to any of the set's elements.\n\n```javascript\nconst set = new Set();\nset.add(10);\nset.add(10); // 10 is strictly equal to 10, so it can't be added again\nset.size;\n//=> 1;\n\nset.has(10);\n//=> true\nset.delete(10);\n//=> true; 10 was removed\nset.delete(10);\n//=> false; 10 is not in the set, so nothing happened\n\nconst obj = { color: 'magenta' };\nconst eerilySimilarObj = { color: 'magenta' };\n\nset.add(obj);\nset.add(eerilySimilarObj); // obj and eerilySimilarObj reference different objects, so they can both be added\nset.size;\n//=> 2\n\nset.clear();\nset.size;\n//=> 0\n```\n\n## Converting between sets and arrays\n\nArrays are converted to sets using the set constructor. Sets can be converted to arrays using either [spread syntax][mdn-spread-syntax] or `Array.from()`.\n\n```javascript\nconst arrayWithDuplicates = [7, 3, 3, 9, 3];\nconst arrayWithoutDuplicates = [...new Set(arrayWithDuplicates)]; // [7, 3, 9]\nconst anotherArrayWithoutDuplicates = Array.from(new Set(arrayWithDuplicates)); // [7, 3, 9]\n```\n\n## Iteration\n\nA set is a [keyed collection][mdn-keyed-collections], which means its elements are indexed by a key and can be iterated in insertion order. Because the _key_ and _value_ of a set element are the same, `Set.keys()` and `Set.values()` are interchangeable.\n\n```javascript\nconst apples = ['Granny Smith', 'Honey Crisp', 'Royal Gala'];\nconst appleSet = new Set(apples);\n\nfor (let apple of appleSet.keys()) {\n  console.log(apple);\n}\n// 'Granny Smith'\n// 'Honey Crisp'\n// 'Royal Gala'\n\nfor (let apple of appleSet.values()) {\n  console.log(apple);\n}\n// 'Granny Smith'\n// 'Honey Crisp'\n// 'Royal Gala'\n\nfor (let apple of appleSet.entries()) {\n  console.log(apple);\n}\n// ['Granny Smith', 'Granny Smith']\n// ['Honey Crisp', 'Honey Crisp']\n// ['Royal Gala', 'Royal Gala']\n```\n\n## Lookup performance vs. arrays\n\nWhen a set is chosen to store a collection of data (rather than an array), it's generally because the stored values need to be unique. However, since it's possible to enforce uniqueness with arrays too, it may not be obvious why that is.\n\nThe short answer is that sets are optimized for searching, and arrays are not. Array search methods (such as `Array.indexOf()`) have runtimes that increase linearly with the size of the array; that is, the more elements the array contains, the longer it takes to search it. Set search methods, on the other hand, have constant runtimes, meaning they stay the same regardless of the set's size.\n\nIn practice, though, this performance difference is negligible unless the collection contains a huge amount of data.\n\n[mdn-strict-equality]: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Equality_comparisons_and_sameness#strict_equality_using\n[mdn-keyed-collections]: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Keyed_collections\n[mdn-spread-syntax]: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Spread_syntax\n",
  "introduction": "# Introduction\n\nIn JavaScript, a [set][mdn-sets] is a list-like structure containing unique values, which can be primitives and/or object references. Unlike an array, a set's elements cannot be accessed by index.\n\nA value cannot be added to a set if it is [strictly equal][mdn-strict-equality] to any of the set's elements.\n\n```javascript\nconst set = new Set();\nconst object = { color: 'lime green' };\nconst functionallyIdenticalObject = { color: 'lime green' };\n\nset.add(object);\nset.add('wow');\nset.add(77);\n\nconsole.log(set.size);\n//=> 3\n\nset.add(functionallyIdenticalObject); // added because functionallyIdenticalObject is not strictly equal to object\nconsole.log(set.size);\n//=> 4\n\nset.add(77); // not added because 77 is strictly equal to 77\nconsole.log(set.size);\n//=> 4\n```\n\n[mdn-sets]: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Set\n[mdn-strict-equality]: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Equality_comparisons_and_sameness#strict_equality_using\n",
