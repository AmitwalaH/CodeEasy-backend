  "about": "# About\n\nJavaScript uses `true` and `false` to represent the two truth values of logic.\n\nIn JavaScript, for each of the three logical operations (AND, OR and NOT) there is a corresponding operator: `&&`, `||` and `!`.\nIn general, there are rules regarding the order of the operations and, in this case, `!` (negation) is applied first, and then `&&` (conjunction) and then `||` (disjunction).\n\nThe order of operations between the operators can be overcome by using an operator with higher precedence: `( )`, named the 'Grouping operator' or simply said 'parentheses'.\nAs a matter of fact, the `( )` operator has the highest precedence of all JavaScript operators.\nMore information about operators precedence is found [here].\n\n[here]: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Operator_Precedence\n",
