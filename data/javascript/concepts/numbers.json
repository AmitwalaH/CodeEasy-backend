  "about": "# About\n\nThere are two different kinds of numbers in JavaScript - numbers and \"bigints\"\n\nNumbers are the most used, and represent numeric data type in the double-precision 64-bit floating-point format.\n\n- `number`: a numeric data type in the double-precision 64-bit floating-point format (IEEE 754).\n  Examples are `-6`, `-2.4`, `0`, `0.1`, `1`, `3.14`, `16.984025`, `25`, `976`, `1024.0` and `500000`.\n- `bigint`: a numeric data type that can represent _integers_ in the arbitrary precision format.\n  Examples are `-12n`, `0n`, `4n`, and `9007199254740991n`.\n\n```javascript\nlet numericValue = 42;\n// => 42\n```\n\nA number literal like `42` in JavaScript code is a floating-point value, not an integer.\nThere is no separate integer type in common everyday use.\nThe `bigint` type is not designed to replace the `number` type for everyday uses.\n`42` is still a `Number`, not a `BigInt`.\n\nNumbers may also be expressed in literal forms like `0b101`, `0o13`, `0x0A`.

The compiler will completely ignore the underscores.\n\n```javascript\nconst num = 1_000_000; // You can read this as 1,000,000\nconsole.log(num);\n// => 1000000\n```\n\n## Built-in Object\n\nThere are two built-in objects that are useful when dealing with numbers:\n\n- [`Number`][built-in-number]: static properties for common / useful values, static methods for [type-checking][concept-type-checking] and [type-conversion][concept-type-conversion], instance methods for [type-conversion][concept-type-conversion] and [formatting numbers as strings][string-formatting].\n- [`Math`][built-in-math]: properties and methods for mathematical constants and functions, does **not** work with `BigInt`.\n\n`Math` also includes methods for rounding numbers.\nYou can read more about the available rounding options in this [javascript.info article on rounding][ref-math-object-rounding].\n\n```javascript\nMath.floor(234.34); // => 234\nMath.ceil(234.34); // => 235\n```\n\nThe `Number` built-in global `object` is _also_ a global `function` that can be used to convert _almost anything_ number-like to a `number`.\nIt is less forgiving than _parsing_ a `string` to a `number`.\n\n```javascript\nconst date = new Date('December 17, 1995 03:24:00');\nconst unix = Number(date);\n\nunix;\n// => 819199440000\n```\n\nThere are three types of maximum (and minimum / maximum negative) values for numbers in JavaScript:\n\n- `VALUE`: given by `Number.MAX_VALUE` and `Number.MIN_VALUE`\n- `INFINITY`: given by `Number.POSITIVE_INFINITY` and `Number.NEGATIVE_INFINITY`\n- `SAFE_INTEGER`: given by `Number.MAX_SAFE_INTEGER` and `Number.MIN_SAFE_INTEGER`\n\nBecause of how numbers in JavaScript are implemented, **not** every number between `Number.MIN_VALUE` and `Number.MAX_VALUE` can be represented.\nHowever, _every_ number between `Number.MIN_SAFE_INTEGER - 1` and `Number.MAX_SAFE_INTEGER + 1` **can** be represented.\n\n## Special Numbers Values\n\nJavaScript has several special number values:\n\n- Two error values, `NaN` and `Infinity`.\n- Two values for zero, `+0` and `-0`.\n\n### NaN - Not a Number\n\nThe error value `NaN`(aka \"Not a Number\") is produced in the following cases.\n\n- A number could not be parsed:\n  ```javascript\n  Number('123'); // => 123\n  Number('Hello, World!'); // => NaN\n  ```\n- An operation failed:\n  ```javascript\n  Math.sqrt(-64); // => NaN\n  ```\n- One of the operands is NaN:\n  ```javascript\n  NaN + 69; // => NaN\n  ```\n\n`NaN` is the only value that is not equal to itself:\n\n```javascript\nNaN === NaN; // => false\n```\n\nIf you want to check whether a value is `NaN`, you have to use the global function `isNaN()`:\n\n```javascript\nisNaN(NaN); // => true\nisNaN(123); // => false\n```\n\n### Infinity\n\n`Infinity` is an error value indicating one of two problems:\n\n- A number can't be represented because its magnitude is too large.\n  ```javascript\n  Math.pow(2, 1024); // => Infinity\n  ```\n- A division by zero has happened.\n  ```javascript\n  6 / 0; // => Infinity\n  -6 / 0; // => -Infinity\n  ```\n\n`Infinity` is larger than any other number (except `NaN`).\nSimilarly, `-Infinity` is smaller than any other number (except `NaN`)\n\nThe global function `isFinite()` allows you to check whether a value is an actual number (neither infinite nor `NaN`):\n\n```javascript\nisFinite(80085); // => true\nisFinite(Infinity); // => false\nisFinite(NaN); // => false\n```\n\n### The Two Zeros\n\n`+0` or `-0` are distinct numbers in JavaScript. They can be produced if you represented a number, that is so small that it is indistinguishable from 0.\nThe signed zero allows you to record “from which direction” you approached zero; that is, what sign the number had before it was considered zero.\nIt is best practice to pretend there's only one zero.\n\n## Comparison\n\nNumbers are considered equal if they have the same value.\n\n```javascript\n1 == 1.0;\n// => true\n\n1 === 1.0;\n// => true\n// Remember, all numbers are floating-points, so this is\n// different syntax for the exact same value.\n\n1 === 1n;\n// => false\n// Strictly checking a number against a bigint will always result\n// in false.\n```\n\nSee [comparison][concept-comparison] for more information on comparisons in general and comparing numeric values in JavaScript.\n\n## Pitfalls\n\nBecause numbers in JavaScript are floating-point numbers, all math using these values is floating-point math.\nTherefore, in JavaScript:\n\n```javascript\n0.1 + 0.2 === 0.3;\n// => false\n```\n\nSee [0.30000000000000004.com](https://0.30000000000000004.com/) for a brief explanation and [Appendix D](https://docs.oracle.com/cd/E19957-01/806-3568/ncg_goldberg.html) of Oracle's Numerical Computation Guide \"What Every Computer Scientist Should Know About Floating-Point Arithmetic\" for an in-depth explanation.\n\n[built-in-number]: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Number\n[built-in-math]: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Math\n[comparison]: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Equality_comparisons_and_sameness\n[lexical-grammar]: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Lexical_grammar#numeric_literals\n[string-formatting]: /tracks/javascript/concepts/string-formatting\n[ref-math-object-rounding]: https://javascript.info/number#rounding\n[concept-comparison]: /tracks/javascript/concepts/comparison\n[concept-type-checking]: /tracks/javascript/concepts/type-checking\n[concept-type-conversion]: /tracks/javascript/concepts/type-conversion\n",
  "introduction": "# Introduction\n\nMany programming languages have specific numeric types to represent different types of numbers, but JavaScript only has two:\n\n- `number`: a numeric data type in the double-precision 64-bit floating-point format (IEEE 754).\n  Examples are `-6`, `-2.4`, `0`, `0.1`, `1`, `3.14`, `16.984025`, `25`, `976`, `1024.0` and `500000`.\n- `bigint`: a numeric data type that can represent _integers_ in the arbitrary precision format.\n  Examples are `-12n`, `0n`, `4n`, and `9007199254740991n`.\n\nIf you require arbitrary precision or work with extremely large numbers, use the `bigint` type.\nOtherwise, the `number` type is likely the better option.\n\n## Rounding\n\nThere is a built-in global object called `Math` that provides various [rounding functions][ref-math-object-rounding]. For example, you can round down (`floor`) or round up (`ceil`) decimal numbers to nearest whole numbers.\n\n```javascript\nMath.floor(234.34); // => 234\nMath.ceil(234.34); // => 235\n```\n\n[ref-math-object-rounding]: https://javascript.info/number#rounding\n",
