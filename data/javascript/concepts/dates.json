  "about": "# Introduction\n\nJavaScript has a built-in object `Date` which stores date and time, and provides methods for their management.\n\n<!-- prettier-ignore -->\n~~~exercism/caution\nIt was based on Java's `java.util.Date` class, which was replaced in the early 2010s, but for backwards compatibility, JavaScript's `Date` sticks around.\n\nBecause of how hard it is to work with Dates in general and because of how bad or non-existing timezone handling is, many libraries exist such as `moment.js`, `day.js`, `date-fns` and `luxon`.\nNone of these are available on Exercism.\n\nIn your own projects, do not use a deprecated / unmaintained package such as `moment.js` but rely on more modern alternatives like `luxon`, or the not yet widely available [Temporal][mdn-temporal].\nThis exercise focusses on `Date`, which will remain relevant until the end of JavaScript.\n\n[mdn-temporal]: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Temporal\n~~~\n\n## Creation\n\nA `Date` object in an instance of the `Date` class.\nIt can be created without passing any arguments to the constructor function.\nThis results in a `Date` object that represents the current date and time:\n\n```javascript\nconst now = new Date();\n// => Thu Apr 14 2022 11:46:08 GMT+0530 (India Standard Time)\n// Shows current day, date and time (in your time zone).\n```\n\n### Unix timestamp (number)\n\nIf a number is passed in, this will be interpreted as a `timestamp`.\nA timestamp is an integer number representing the number of **milliseconds** that has passed since **1 January 1970 [UTC][defn-utc]+0**.\n\n```javascript\nconst epoch = new Date(0);\n// Thu Jan 01 1970 01:00:00 GMT+0100 (Central European Standard Time)\n\nconst another = new Date(1749508766627);\n// Tue Jun 10 2025 00:39:26 GMT+0200 (Central European Summer Time)\n```\n\nOne may expect `new Date(0)` to generate the \"earliest\" date object, but JavaScript will convert the date to your local timezone, which means that only those around [GMT / with an UTC+0][defn-gmt] timezone will actually get the [Unix epoch][defn-unix-epoch] value.\n\n### ISO 8601 timestamp (string)\n\nYou can pass a string value representing a date to the `Date` constructor.\nThe **only** format that is consistent across implementations is the [simplified version][mdn-date-string-format] of the internationally recognized and standardized so-called [ISO 8601 timestamp strings][defn-iso8601].\n\nA moment in time at [UTC][defn-gmt] looks like this:\n\n```text\nYYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm:ss.mssZ\nYYYYMMDDTHHmmss.mssZ\n```\n\nWhere the following substitutions take place:\n\n| Key  | Description                                   | Default |\n| ---- | --------------------------------------------- | ------- |\n| YYYY | The calendar year, represented in 4 digits    |         |\n| MM   | The calendar month, represented in 2 digits   | 01      |\n| DD   | The calendar day, represented in 2 digits     | 01      |\n| T    | A literal letter T, separating date from time |         |\n| HH   | The hours in a 24-hour clock, 2 digits        | 00      |\n| mm   | The minutes, 2 digits                         | 00      |\n| ss   | The seconds, 2 digits                         | 00      |\n| mss  | The milliseconds, 3 digits                    | 000     |\n| Z    | A literal letter Z, or an offset `+/-HH:mm`   |         |\n\nThe literal letter `Z` indicates UTC (no timezone, no Day Light Savings).\n\nBecause there are default values for most components, leaving parts off at the end is valid:\n\n```text\nYYYY-MM-DD\n```\n\nDefaults to a time of 00:00:00.000\n\nIf the timestamp does not end in `Z`, and it does not end with `+HH:mm` or `-HH:mm` (indicating a timezone offset), because of historical reasons, the following applies:\n\n> When the time zone offset is absent, date-only forms are interpreted as a UTC time and date-time forms are interpreted as a local time.\n> The interpretation as a UTC time is due to a historical spec error that was not consistent with ISO 8601 but could not be changed due to web compatibility.\n> See [Broken Parser – A Web Reality Issue][ref-broken-parser].\n\n### Date object\n\nAn existing date object can also be used as a constructor argument.\nThis makes a copy of the existing `Date` object with the same date and time.\n\n```javascript\nconst t1 = new Date();\nconst t2 = new Date(t1);\n// Values of t1 and t2 will be the same.\n```\n\n### Supplying individual date and time component values\n\nA date representing a date can be created by passing three numbers.\nA date representing a date and time can be created by passing in 6 numbers.\n\n```javascript\nconst date1 = new Date(95, 11, 17);\n// Creates Date for Dec 17 1995 00:00 if your local timezone is equivalent to UTC.\n\nconst date2 = new Date(2013, 12, 5, 13, 24, 0);\n// Creates Date for Jan 5 2014 13:24 if your local timezone is equivalent to UTC.\n```\n\nThe second value is the `month`, which starts at `0` for January, up to `11` for December.\n\n## `Date.parse()`\n\nYou may find mentions of or references to a date parsing function `Date.parse`.\nBecause there are only a few invariants (truths) for this function and because the rest of the implementation is not specified (and thus not standard), one should not use it.\n\n## Accessing `Date` components\n\nThere are various methods on date objects that return the components of the date:\n\n```javascript\ngetFullYear(); // Get the year (4 digits)\ngetMonth(); // Get the month, from 0 to 11.\ngetDate(); // Get the day of month, from 1 to 31.\ngetHours(); // Get the hour in a 24 clock, from 0 to 23\ngetMinutes(); // Get the minutes, from 0 to 59\ngetSeconds(); // Get the seconds, from 0 to 59\ngetMilliseconds(); // Get the milliseconds, from 0 and 999\ngetDay(); // Get the day of week, from 0 (Sunday) to 6 (Saturday).\n```\n\nEach of these has an applicable `set` variant (e.g. `setFullYear`) to update the value.\nAny overflowing value rolls over to the next component:\n\n```javascript\nconst date = new Date('2025-02-28T12:42:00Z');\n// => Fri Feb 28 2025 13:42:00 GMT+0100 (Central European Standard Time)\n\ndate.setDate(29);\n// there was no February 29th in 2025.\n\ndate.getDate();\n// => 1\n\ndate.toString();\n// => Sat Mar 01 2025 13:42:00 GMT+0100 (Central European Standard Time)\n```\n\nThere are UTC variants for all the methods that disregard the local timezone.\n\n## Converting from date\n\nDate objects have a method `getTime()` that returns the UNIX timestamp in milliseconds, ie. amount of milliseconds the midnight at the beginning of January 1, 1970, UTC.\nAdditionally, a method `toISOString()` is available to convert from a date object to a ISO 8601 timestamp string.\n\n## Comparing Dates\n\nGreater than (`>`) and greater than or equals (`>=`) as well as less than (`<`) and less than or equals (`<=`) can be used directly between two dates or a date and a number.\nThis works because JavaScript will try to coerce the date to a primitive.\n\n<!-- prettier-ignore -->\n~~~exercism/advanced\nWhen doing a comparison between two dates or date and a number, JavaScript calls [`[Symbol.toPrimitive](\"number\")`][mdn-to-primitive] which internally calls [`date.valueOf()`][mdn-date-value-of].\nThe latter is the same as calling [`date.getTime()`][mdn-date-get-time].\n\nIf you do not want to rely on this behaviour, convert to a number using `getTime()` first.\n\n[mdn-to-primitive]: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Date/Symbol.toPrimitive\n[mdn-date-value-of]:
