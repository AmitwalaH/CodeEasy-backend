    "introduction": "# Introduction\r\n\r\n## General syntax\r\n\r\nThe for loop is one of the most commonly used statements to repeatedly execute some logic. In Go it consists of the `for` keyword, a header and a code block that contains the body of the loop wrapped in curly brackets. The header consists of 3 components separated by semicolons `;`: init, condition and post.\r\n\r\n```go\r\nfor init; condition; post {\r\n  // loop body - code that is executed repeatedly as long as the condition is true\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n- The **init** component is some code that runs only once before the loop starts.\r\n- The **condition** component must be some expression that evaluates to a boolean and controls when the loop should stop. The code inside the loop will run as long as this condition evaluates to true. As soon as this expression evaluates to false, no more iterations of the loop will run.\r\n- The **post** component is some code that will run at the end of each iteration.\r\n\r\n**Note:** Unlike other languages, there are no parentheses `()` surrounding the three components of the header. In fact, inserting such parenthesis is a compilation error. However, the braces `{ }` surrounding the loop body are always required.\r\n\r\n## For Loops - An example\r\n\r\nThe init component usually sets up a counter variable, the condition checks whether the loop should be continued or stopped and the post component usually increments the counter at the end of each repetition.\r\n\r\n```go\r\nfor i := 1; i < 10; i++ {\r\n  fmt.Println(i)\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis loop will print the numbers from `1` to `9` (including `9`). \r\nDefining the step is often done using an increment or decrement statement, as shown in the example above.\r\n\r\n",
    "instructions": "# Instructions\r\n\r\nYou are an avid bird watcher that keeps track of how many birds have visited your garden.\r\nUsually you use a tally in a notebook to count the birds, but to better work with your data, you've digitalized the bird counts for the past weeks.\r\n\r\n## 1. Determine the total number of birds that you counted so far\r\n\r\nLet us start analyzing the data by getting a high level view.\r\nFind out how many birds you counted in total since you started your logs.\r\n\r\nImplement a function `TotalBirdCount` that accepts a slice of `int`s that contains the bird count per day.\r\nIt should return the total number of birds that you counted.\r\n\r\n```go\r\nbirdsPerDay := []int{2, 5, 0, 7, 4, 1, 3, 0, 2, 5, 0, 1, 3, 1}\r\nTotalBirdCount(birdsPerDay)\r\n// => 34\r\n```\r\n\r\n## 2. Calculate the number of visiting birds in a specific week\r\n\r\nNow that you got a general feel for your bird count numbers, you want to make a more fine-grained analysis.\r\n\r\nImplement a function `BirdsInWeek` that accepts a slice of bird counts per day and a week number.\r\n\r\nIt returns the total number of birds that you counted in that specific week.\r\nYou can assume weeks are always tracked completely.\r\n\r\n```go\r\nbirdsPerDay := []int{2, 5, 0, 7, 4, 1, 3, 0, 2, 5, 0, 1, 3, 1}\r\nBirdsInWeek(birdsPerDay, 2)\r\n// => 12\r\n```\r\n\r\n## 3. Fix a counting mistake\r\n\r\nYou realized that all the time you were trying to keep track of the birds, there was one bird that was hiding in a far corner of the garden.\r\n\r\nYou figured out that this bird always spent every second day in your garden.\r\n\r\nYou do not know exactly where it was in between those days but definitely not in your garden.\r\n\r\nYour bird watcher intuition also tells you that the bird was in your garden on the first day that you tracked in your list.\r\n\r\nGiven this new information, write a function `FixBirdCountLog` that takes a slice of birds counted per day as an argument and returns the slice after correcting the counting mistake.\r\n\r\n```go\r\nbirdsPerDay := []int{2, 5, 0, 7, 4, 1}\r\nFixBirdCountLog(birdsPerDay)\r\n// => [3 5 1 7 5 1]\r\n```\r\n",
    "hints": "# Hints\r\n\r\n## 1. Determine the total number of birds that you counted so far\r\n\r\n- Refer to the exercise introduction for an example how to use a for loop to iterate over a slice.\r\n- Use a helper variable to store the total count and increase that variable as you go through the slice.\r\n- Think about the correct initial value for that helper variable.\r\n\r\n## 2. Calculate the number of visiting birds in a specific week\r\n\r\n- This task is similar to the first one, you can copy your code as a starting point.\r\n- Think about which indexes in the slice you would need to take into account for week number 1 and 2, respectively.\r\n- Now find a general way to calculate the first and the last index that should be considered.\r\n- With that you can set up the for loop to only iterate over the relevant section of the slice.\r\n\r\n## 3. Fix a counting mistake\r\n\r\n- Again you need to set up a for loop to iterate over the whole bird count slice.\r\n- This time you only need to visit every second entry in the slice.\r\n- Change the step so the counter variable is increased accordingly after each iteration.\r\n- In the body of the for loop you can use the increment operator to change the value of an element in a slice in-place.\r\n"
