    "introduction": "# Introduction\r\n\r\n## Numbers\r\n\r\nGo contains basic numeric types that can represent sets of either integer or floating-point values.\r\nThere are different types depending on the size of value you require and the architecture of the computer where the application is running (e.g. 32-bit and 64-bit).\r\n\r\nFor the sake of this exercise you will only be dealing with:\r\n\r\n- `int`: e.g. `0`, `255`, `2147483647`. A signed integer that is at least 32 bits in size (value range of: -2147483648 through 2147483647).\r\n  But this will depend on the systems architecture.\r\n  Most modern computers are 64 bit, therefore `int` will be 64 bits in size (value rate of: -9223372036854775808 through 9223372036854775807).\r\n\r\n- `float64`: e.g. `0.0`, `3.14`. Contains the set of all 64-bit floating-point numbers.\r\n\r\n- `uint`: e.g. `0`, `255`. An unsigned integer that is the same size as `int` (value range of: 0 through 4294967295 for 32 bits and 0 through 18446744073709551615 for 64 bits)\r\n\r\nNumbers can be converted to other numeric types through Type Conversion.\r\n\r\n## Arithmetic Operators\r\n\r\nGo supports many standard arithmetic operators:\r\n\r\n| Operator | Example        |\r\n| -------- | -------------- |\r\n| `+`      | `4 + 6 == 10`  |\r\n| `-`      | `15 - 10 == 5` |\r\n| `*`      | `2 * 3 == 6`   |\r\n| `/`      | `13 / 3 == 4`  |\r\n| `%`      | `13 % 3 == 1`  |\r\n\r\nFor integer division, the remainder is dropped (e.g. `5 / 2 == 2`).\r\n\r\nGo has shorthand assignment for the operators above (e.g. `a += 5` is short for `a = a + 5`).\r\nGo also supports the increment and decrement statements `++` and `--` (e.g. `a++`).\r\n\r\n## Converting between types \r\n\r\nConverting between types is done via a function with the name of the type to convert to.\r\nFor example:\r\n\r\n```go\r\nvar x int = 42 // x has type int\r\nf := float64(x) // f has type float64 (ie. 42.0)\r\nvar y float64 = 11.9 // y has type float64\r\ni := int(y) // i has type int (ie. 11)\r\n```\r\n## Arithmetic operations on different types\r\n\r\nIn many languages you can perform arithmetic operations on different types of variables, but in Go this gives an error.\r\nFor example:\r\n\r\n```go\r\nvar x int = 42\r\n\r\n// this line produces an error\r\nvalue := float32(2.0) * x // invalid operation: mismatched types float32 and int\r\n\r\n// you must convert int type to float32 before performing arithmetic operation\r\nvalue := float32(2.0) * float32(x)\r\n```\r\n",
    "instructions": "# Instructions\r\n\r\nIn this exercise you'll be writing code to analyze the production in a car factory.\r\n\r\n## 1. Calculate the number of working cars produced per hour\r\n\r\nThe cars are produced on an assembly line. \r\nThe assembly line has a certain speed, that can be changed. \r\nThe faster the assembly line speed is, the more cars are produced. \r\nHowever, changing the speed of the assembly line also changes the number of cars that are produced successfully, that is cars without any errors in their production.\r\n\r\nImplement a function that takes in the number of cars produced per hour and the success rate and calculates the number of successful cars made per hour. The success rate is given as a percentage, from `0` to `100`:\r\n\r\n```go\r\nCalculateWorkingCarsPerHour(1547, 90)\r\n// => 1392.3\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Note:** the return value should be a `float64`.\r\n\r\n## 2. Calculate the number of working cars produced per minute\r\n\r\nImplement a function that takes in the number of cars produced per hour and the success rate and calculates how many cars are successfully produced each minute:\r\n\r\n```go\r\nCalculateWorkingCarsPerMinute(1105, 90)\r\n// => 16\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Note:** the return value should be an `int`.\r\n\r\n## 3. Calculate the cost of production \r\n\r\nEach car normally costs $10,000 to produce individually, regardless of whether it is successful or not.\r\nBut with a bit of planning, 10 cars can be produced together for $95,000.\r\n\r\nFor example, 37 cars can be produced in the following way:\r\n37 = 3 x groups of ten + 7 individual cars\r\n\r\nSo the cost for 37 cars is:\r\n3\\*95,000+7\\*10,000=355,000\r\n\r\nImplement the function `CalculateCost` that calculates the cost of producing a number of cars, regardless of whether they are successful:\r\n\r\n```go\r\nCalculateCost(37)\r\n// => 355000\r\n\r\nCalculateCost(21)\r\n// => 200000\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Note:** the return value should be an `uint`.\r\n",
    "hints": "# Hints\r\n\r\n## General\r\n\r\n- To learn more about types in Go, check [Tour of Go: Basic Types][basic types].\r\n- To learn more about type conversions in Go, check [Tour of Go: Type Conversions][type conversions].\r\n\r\n## 1. Calculate the number of working cars produced per hour\r\n\r\n- The percentage (passed as an argument) is a number between 0-100. To make this percentage a bit easier to work with, start by dividing it by 100.\r\n- To compute the number of cars produced successfully, multiply the percentage (divided by 100) by the number of cars produced.\r\n- When multiplying two numbers together, they both need to be of the same type. Use [type conversions][type conversions] if needed.\r\n\r\n## 2. Calculate the number of working cars produced per minute\r\n\r\n- Start by calculating the production of successful cars per hour. For this, you can use the `CalculateProductionRatePerHour` function you made from the previous step.\r\n- Knowing the production per hour of cars, you can get the production per minute by dividing the production per hour by 60 (the number of minutes in an hour).\r\n- Remember to cast the result to an `int`.\r\n\r\n## 3. Calculate the cost of production \r\n\r\n- Start by working out how many groups of 10 cars there are. You can do this by dividing the number of cars by 10.\r\n- Then work out how many cars are remaining (the [modulo operator][modulo operator] is useful for this).\r\n- To arrive at the cost, multiply the number of groups by the cost to produce 10 cars and then multiply the number of cars remaining by the cost to produce each individual car. Then sum the results of the multiplication together.\r\n\r\n[basic types]: https://tour.golang.org/basics/11\r\n[type conversions]: https://tour.golang.org/basics/13\r\n[modulo operator]: https://golangbyexample.com/remainder-modulus-go-golang/\r\n"
