    "introduction": "# Introduction\r\n\r\n[Go](https://golang.org) is a statically typed, compiled programming language.\r\nThis exercise introduces three major language features: Packages, Functions, and Variables.\r\n\r\n## Packages\r\n\r\nGo applications are organized in packages.\r\nA package is a collection of source files located in the same directory.\r\nAll source files in a directory must share the same package name.\r\nWhen a package is imported, only entities (functions, types, variables, constants) whose names start with a capital letter can be used / accessed.\r\nThe recommended style of naming in Go is that identifiers will be named using `camelCase`, except for those meant to be accessible across packages which should be `PascalCase`.\r\n\r\n```go\r\npackage lasagna\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Variables\r\n\r\nGo is statically-typed, which means all variables [must have a defined type](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_system) at compile-time.\r\n\r\nVariables can be defined by explicitly specifying a type:\r\n\r\n```go\r\nvar explicit int // Explicitly typed\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou can also use an initializer, and the compiler will assign the variable type to match the type of the initializer.\r\n\r\n```go\r\nimplicit := 10   // Implicitly typed as an int\r\n```\r\n\r\nOnce declared, variables can be assigned values using the `=` operator.\r\nOnce declared, a variable's type can never change.\r\n\r\n```go\r\ncount := 1 // Assign initial value\r\ncount = 2  // Update to new value\r\n\r\ncount = false // This throws a compiler error due to assigning a non `int` type\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Constants\r\n\r\nConstants hold a piece of data just like variables, but their value cannot change during the execution of the program.\r\n\r\nConstants are defined using the `const` keyword and can be numbers, characters, strings or booleans:\r\n\r\n```go\r\nconst Age = 21 // Defines a numeric constant 'Age' with the value of 21\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Functions\r\n\r\nGo functions accept zero or more parameters.\r\nParameters must be explicitly typed, there is no type inference.\r\n\r\nValues are returned from functions using the `return` keyword.\r\n\r\nA function is invoked by specifying the function name and passing arguments for each of the function's parameters.\r\n\r\nNote that Go supports two types of comments.\r\nSingle line comments are preceded by `//` and multiline comments are inserted between `/*` and `*/`.\r\n\r\n```go\r\npackage greeting\r\n\r\n// Hello is a public function.\r\nfunc Hello (name string) string {\r\n    return hi(name)\r\n}\r\n\r\n// hi is a private function.\r\nfunc hi (name string) string {\r\n    return \"hi \" + name\r\n}\r\n```\r\n",
    "instructions": "# Instructions\r\n\r\nIn this exercise you're going to write some code to help you cook a brilliant lasagna from your favorite cooking book.\r\n\r\nYou have four tasks, all related to the time spent cooking the lasagna.\r\n\r\n## 1. Define the expected oven time in minutes\r\n\r\nDefine the `OvenTime` constant with how many minutes the lasagna should be in the oven. According to the cooking book, the expected oven time in minutes is 40:\r\n\r\n```go\r\nOvenTime\r\n// => 40\r\n```\r\n\r\n## 2. Calculate the remaining oven time in minutes\r\n\r\nDefine the `RemainingOvenTime()` function that takes the actual minutes the lasagna has been in the oven as a parameter and returns how many minutes the lasagna still has to remain in the oven, based on the expected oven time in minutes from the previous task.\r\n\r\n```go\r\nfunc RemainingOvenTime(actual int) int {\r\n    // TODO\r\n}\r\n\r\nRemainingOvenTime(30)\r\n// => 10\r\n```\r\n\r\n## 3. Calculate the preparation time in minutes\r\n\r\nDefine the `PreparationTime` function that takes the number of layers you added to the lasagna as a parameter and returns how many minutes you spent preparing the lasagna, assuming each layer takes you 2 minutes to prepare.\r\n\r\n```go\r\nfunc PreparationTime(numberOfLayers int) int {\r\n    // TODO\r\n}\r\n\r\nPreparationTime(2)\r\n// => 4\r\n```\r\n\r\n## 4. Calculate the elapsed working time in minutes\r\n\r\nDefine the `ElapsedTime` function that takes two parameters: the first parameter is the number of layers you added to the lasagna, and the second parameter is the number of minutes the lasagna has been in the oven.\r\nThe function should return how many minutes in total you've worked on cooking the lasagna, which is the sum of the preparation time in minutes, and the time in minutes the lasagna has spent in the oven at the moment.\r\n\r\n```go\r\nfunc ElapsedTime(numberOfLayers, actualMinutesInOven int) int {\r\n    // TODO\r\n}\r\n\r\nElapsedTime(3, 20)\r\n// => 26\r\n```\r\n",
    "hints": "# Hints\r\n\r\n## General\r\n\r\n- An [integer value][integers] can be defined as one or more consecutive digits.\r\n- If you see a `panic:` error when running the tests, this is because you have not implemented one of the functions (it should say which one) or you have left the boilerplate in place. You need to remove the `panic(...)` line from the supplied code and replace it with a real implementation.\r\n\r\n## 1. Define the expected oven time in minutes\r\n\r\n- You need to define a [constant][constants] and assign it the expected oven time in minutes.\r\n- If you see an `undefined: OvenTime` error then double check that you have the constant defined.\r\n- If you see an `invalid operation: got != tt.expected (mismatched types float64 and int)` error then you have likely put a decimal point into the `OvenTime` causing Go to infer the type as a floating point number. Remove the decimal and the type will be inferred as an `int`.\r\n- If you see a `syntax error: non-declaration statement outside function body` error then it is likely that you forgot the `const` keyword.\r\n- If you see a `syntax error: unexpected :=, expecting =` error then you are likely trying to assign the constant using `:=` like a variable; constants are assigned using `=` not `:=`.\r\n\r\n## 2. Calculate the remaining oven time in minutes\r\n\r\n- You need to define a [function][functions] with a single parameter.\r\n- You have to [explicitly return an integer][return] from a function.\r\n- The function's parameter is an [integer][integers].\r\n- You can [call][calls] one of the other functions you've defined previously.\r\n- You can use the [mathematical operator for subtraction][operators] to subtract values.\r\n\r\n## 3. Calculate the preparation time in minutes\r\n\r\n- You need to define a [function][functions] with a single parameter.\r\n- You have to [explicitly return an integer][return] from a function.\r\n- The function's parameter is an [integer][integers].\r\n- You can use the [mathematical operator for multiplication][operators] to multiply values.\r\n\r\n## 4. Calculate the elapsed working time in minutes\r\n\r\n- You need to define a [function][functions] with two parameters.\r\n- You have to [explicitly return an integer][return] from a function.\r\n- The function's parameter is an [integer][integers].\r\n- You can [call][calls] one of the other functions you've defined previously.\r\n- You can use the [mathematical operator for addition][operators] to add values.\r\n\r\n[functions]: https://tour.golang.org/basics/4\r\n[return]: https://golang.org/ref/spec#Return_statements\r\n[operators]: https://golang.org/ref/spec#Operators\r\n[integers]: https://golang.org/ref/spec#Integer_literals\r\n[calls]: https://golang.org/ref/spec#Calls\r\n[constants]: https://tour.golang.org/basics/15\r\n"
