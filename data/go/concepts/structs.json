    "about": "# About\r\n\r\nIn Go, a `struct` is a sequence of named elements called _fields_, each field has a name and type.\r\nThe name of a field must be unique within the struct.\r\nStructs can be compared with _classes_ in the Object-Oriented Programming paradigm.\r\n\r\n## Defining a struct\r\n\r\nYou create a new struct by using the `type` and `struct` keywords, and explicitly define the name and type of the fields.\r\nFor example, here we define `Shape` struct, that holds the name of a shape and its size:\r\n\r\n```go\r\ntype Shape struct {\r\n    name string\r\n    size int\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nField names in structs follow the Go convention - fields whose name starts with a lower case letter are only visible to code in the same package, whereas those whose name starts with an upper case letter are visible in other packages.\r\n\r\n## Creating instances of a struct\r\n\r\nOnce you have defined the `struct`, you need to create a new instance defining the fields using their field name\r\nin any order:\r\n\r\n```go\r\ns := Shape {\r\n    name: \"Square\",\r\n    size: 25,\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nTo read or modify instance fields, use the `.` notation:\r\n\r\n```go\r\n// Update the name and the size\r\ns.name = \"Circle\"\r\ns.size = 35\r\nfmt.Printf(\"name: %s size: %d\\n\", s.name, s.size)\r\n// Output: name: Circle size: 35\r\n```\r\n\r\nFields that don't have an initial value assigned, will have their zero value. For example:\r\n\r\n```go\r\ns := Shape{name: \"Circle\"}\r\nfmt.Printf(\"name: %s size: %d\\n\", s.name, s.size)\r\n// Output: name: Circle size: 0\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou can create an instance of a `struct` without using the field names, as long as you define the fields _in order_:\r\n\r\n```go\r\ns := Shape {\r\n\t\"Oval\",\r\n\t20,\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nHowever, this syntax is considered _brittle code_ since it can break when a field is added, especially when the new field is of a different type.\r\nIn the following example we add an extra field to `Shape`:\r\n\r\n```go\r\ntype Shape struct {\r\n\tname        string\r\n\tdescription string // new field 'description' added\r\n\tsize        int\r\n}\r\n\r\ns := Shape{\r\n    \"Circle\",\r\n    20,\r\n}\r\n// Since the second field of the struct is now a string and not an int,\r\n// the compiler will throw an error when compiling the program:\r\n// Output: cannot use 20 (type untyped int) as type string in field value\r\n// Output: too few values in Shape{...}\r\n```\r\n\r\n## \"New\" functions\r\n\r\nSometimes it can be nice to have functions that help us create struct instances.\r\nBy convention, these functions are usually called `New` or have their names starting with `New`, but since they are just regular functions, you can give them any name you want.\r\nThey might remind you of constructors in other languages, but in Go they are just regular functions.\r\n\r\nIn the following example, one of these `New` functions is used to create a new instance of `Shape` and automatically set a default value for the `size` of the shape:\r\n\r\n```go\r\nfunc NewShape(name string) Shape {\r\n\treturn Shape{\r\n\t\tname: name,\r\n\t\tsize: 100, //default-value for size is 100\r\n\t}\r\n}\r\n\r\nNewShape(\"Triangle\")\r\n// => Shape { name: \"Triangle\", size: 100 }\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nUsing `New` functions can have the following advantages:\r\n* validation of the given values\r\n* handling of default-values\r\n* since `New` functions are often declared in the same package of the structs they initialize, they can initialize even private fields of the struct\r\n\r\nTo dive deeper into this type, you can check these resources: [Go by Example: Structs][go-by-example-structs], [A Tour of Go: Structs][tour-of-go-structs] or [Structures in Go (structs)][medium-structures-in-go]\r\n\r\n## `new` builtin\r\n\r\nAnother way of creating a new instance of a struct is by using the `new` built-in: \r\n\r\n```go\r\ns := new(Shape) // s will be of type *Shape (pointer to shape)\r\nfmt.Printf(\"name: %s size: %d\\n\", s.name, s.size)\r\n// Output: name:  size: 0\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn this example, `new` creates an instance of the struct `Shape` with all the values initialized to the zero value of their type and returns a pointer to it.\r\n\r\n~~~~exercism/note\r\nMore often than not, you will not see new instances of structs created using the `new` builtin.\r\nAlways prefer using a struct literal, a custom `New` function or any other function provided by the package that can help you build a struct.\r\nUse the `new` builtin to create new instances of structs as a last resort.\r\n~~~~\r\n\r\n[go-by-example-structs]: https://gobyexample.com/structs\r\n[medium-structures-in-go]: https://medium.com/rungo/structures-in-go-76377cc106a2\r\n[tour-of-go-structs]: https://tour.golang.org/moretypes/2\r\n",
