    "about": "# About\r\n\r\nGo contains basic numeric types that can represent sets of either integer or\r\nfloating-point values. There a different types depending on the size of value\r\nyou require and the architecture of the computer where the application is\r\nrunning (e.g. 32-bit and 64-bit).\r\n\r\nThis concept will concentrate on two number types:\r\n\r\n- `int`: e.g. `0`, `255`, `2147483647`. A signed integer that is at least 32\r\n  bits in size (value range of: -2147483648 through 2147483647). But this will\r\n  depend on the systems architecture. Most modern computers are 64 bit,\r\n  therefore `int` will be 64 bits in size (value rate of:\r\n  -9223372036854775808 through 9223372036854775807).\r\n\r\n- `float64`: e.g. `0.0`, `3.14`. Contains the set of all 64-bit floating-point\r\n  numbers.\r\n\r\nFor a full list of the available numeric types and more detail see the\r\nfollowing resources:\r\n\r\n- [Go builtin type declarations][go-builtins]\r\n- [Digital Ocean - Understanding Data Types in Go][do-understanding-types]\r\n- [Arden Labs - Understanding Type in Go][arden-understanding-types]\r\n\r\nGo supports the standard set of arithmetic operators of `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`\r\nand `%` (remainder not modulo).\r\n\r\nIn Go, assignment of a value between different types requires explicit\r\nconversion. For example, to convert an `int` to a `float64` you would need to\r\ndo the following:\r\n\r\n```go\r\nvar x int = 42\r\nf := float64(x)\r\n\r\nfmt.Printf(\"x is of type: %s\\n\", reflect.TypeOf(x))\r\n// Output: x is of type: int\r\n\r\nfmt.Printf(\"f is of type: %s\\n\", reflect.TypeOf(f))\r\n// Output: f is of type: float64\r\n```\r\n\r\nFor more information on Type Conversion please see\r\n[A Tour of Go: Type Conversions][type-conversion]\r\n\r\n[type-conversion]: https://tour.golang.org/basics/13\r\n[go-builtins]: https://github.com/golang/go/blob/master/src/builtin/builtin.go\r\n[do-understanding-types]: https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/understanding-data-types-in-go\r\n[arden-understanding-types]: https://www.ardanlabs.com/blog/2013/07/understanding-type-in-go.html\r\n",
