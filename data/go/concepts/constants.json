    "about": "# About\r\n\r\nConstants in Go are simple, [unchanging values][const] created with the `const` keyword. Constants may be given an explicit type:\r\n\r\n```go\r\nconst hi string = \"hi\" // string\r\n```\r\n\r\nor an implicit, default type:\r\n\r\n```go\r\nconst hello = \"hello\" // string\r\n```\r\n\r\nwhen the variable needs a type. This gives constants more flexibility in Go's type system and allows them to work in a variety of contexts without triggering a compiler error:\r\n\r\n```go\r\nconst number2 = 2 // 2 is an untyped numeric constant and does not need to be explicitly given the type float64 as required by the Sqrt method\r\nsqrt2 := math.Sqrt(number2)\r\n```\r\n\r\nGo does not have enums like some other languages but the `iota` enumerator can be used to create successive untyped integer constants:\r\n\r\n```go\r\nconst (\r\n    a = 6 * iota // 0\r\n    b            // 6\r\n    c            // 12\r\n    d            // 18\r\n)\r\n```\r\n\r\nComplex types like maps and slices are mutable and cannot be constants; the compiler will throw errors:\r\n\r\n```go\r\nfunc main() {\r\n    const m = map[int]int{2: 8}\r\n    const s = []string{\"exercism\", \"v3\"}\r\n}\r\n// => const initializer map[int]int literal is not a constant\r\n// => const initializer []string literal is not a constant\r\n```\r\n\r\nFor a fuller explanation please see the resources [here][const2], [here][const3], and [here][const4].\r\n\r\n[const]: https://golang.org/ref/spec#Constants\r\n[const2]: https://golang.org/doc/effective_go.html#constants\r\n[const3]: https://blog.golang.org/constants\r\n[const4]: https://yourbasic.org/golang/untyped-constants/\r\n",
    "introduction": "# Introduction\r\n\r\nIn Go, a constant is a simple, unchanging value assigned to a name with the `const` keyword:\r\n\r\n```go\r\nconst myWebsite = \"Exercism\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nSuch constants are untyped, but they are given a default type based on their syntax when a type is required, such as when they are passed to a method. Typed constants can be created by explicitly adding a type:\r\n\r\n```go\r\nconst myWebsite string = \"Exercism\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nGo does not have enums like some other languages, but does have a predeclared identifier called `iota` for creating enumerated constants. Constants in a block are implicitly repeated:\r\n\r\n```go\r\nconst (\r\n    a = 9\r\n    b\r\n    c\r\n    d = iota\r\n    e\r\n    f\r\n    g\r\n)\r\nfmt.Print(a, b, c, d, e, f, g)\r\n// Output: 9 9 9 3 4 5 6\r\n```\r\n"
