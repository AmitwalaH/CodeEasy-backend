the tests passing and the code clean? If you want to, these\r\nare some additional things you could try:\r\n\r\n* Remove as much duplication as you possibly can.\r\n* Optimize for readability, even if it means introducing duplication.\r\n* If you've removed all the duplication, do you have a lot of\r\n  conditionals? Try replacing the conditionals with polymorphism, if it\r\n  applies in this language. How readable is it?\r\n\r\nThen please share your thoughts in a comment on the submission. Did this\r\nexperiment make the code better? Worse? Did you learn anything from it?\r\n",
