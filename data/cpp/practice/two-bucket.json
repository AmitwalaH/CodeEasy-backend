Pouring one bucket into the other bucket until either:\r\n     a) the first bucket is empty\r\n     b) the second bucket is full\r\n  2. Emptying a bucket and doing nothing to the other.\r\n  3. Filling a bucket and doing nothing to the other.\r\n- After an action, you may not arrive at a state where the initial starting bucket is empty and the other bucket is full.\r\n\r\nYour program will take as input:\r\n\r\n- the size of bucket one\r\n- the size of bucket two\r\n- the desired number of liters to reach\r\n- which bucket to fill first, either bucket one or bucket two\r\n\r\nYour program should determine:\r\n\r\n- the total number of actions it should take to reach the desired number of liters, including the first fill of the starting bucket\r\n- which bucket should end up with the desired number of liters - either bucket one or bucket two\r\n- how many liters are left in the other bucket\r\n\r\nNote: any time a change is made to either or both buckets counts as one (1) action.\r\n\r\nExample:\r\nBucket one can hold up to 7 liters, and bucket two can hold up to 11 liters.\r\nLet's say at a given step, bucket one is holding 7 liters and bucket two is holding 8 liters (7,8).\r\nIf you empty bucket one and make no change to bucket two, leaving you with 0 liters and 8 liters respectively (0,8), that counts as one action.\r\nInstead, if you had poured from bucket one into bucket two until bucket two was full, resulting in 4 liters in bucket one and 11 liters in bucket two (4,11), that would also only count as one action.\r\n\r\nAnother Example:\r\nBucket one can hold 3 liters, and bucket two can hold up to 5 liters.\r\nYou are told you must start with bucket one.\r\nSo your first action is to fill bucket one.\r\nYou choose to empty bucket one for your second action.\r\nFor your third action, you may not fill bucket two, because this violates the third rule -- you may not end up in a state after any action where the starting bucket is empty and the other bucket is full.\r\n\r\nWritten with <3 at [Fullstack Academy][fullstack] by Lindsay Levine.\r\n\r\n[fullstack]: https://www.fullstackacademy.com/\r\n",
