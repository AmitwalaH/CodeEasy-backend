    "introduction": "# Introduction\r\n\r\n## Comparisons\r\n\r\nIn C++, you can compare values using the comparison operators.\r\n\r\n| Comparison        | Operator  |\r\n| ------------------| --------- |\r\n| equal             | `==`      |\r\n| not equal         | `!=`      |\r\n| less              | `<`       |\r\n| less or equal     | `<=`      |\r\n| greater           | `>`       |\r\n| greater or equal  | `>=`      |\r\n\r\nThe result of these comparisons is always a boolean value:\r\n\r\n```cpp\r\nint a{3};\r\n\r\nbool eq1 = a != 4; // true\r\n\r\nbool eq2 = a > 5;  // false\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe operators `==` and `!=` check whether a value is equal to another or not, respectively.\r\nHere are some common examples:\r\n\r\n```cpp\r\nbool eq3 = 2 == 3; // false, integer comparison\r\n\r\nbool eq4 = 2.1 != 2.2; // true, float comparison\r\n\r\nbool eq5 = \"hello\" == \"hello\"; // true, string comparison\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe other operators check if one value is greater than (`>`), greater or equal to (`>=`), less than (`<`), and less or equal to (`<=`) to another value.\r\nThis kind of comparison is available for numbers and strings.\r\nWhen comparing strings, the dictionary order (also known as lexicographic order) is followed.\r\n\r\n```cpp\r\nbool eq6 = 2 > 3; // false, integer comparison\r\n\r\nbool eq7 = 1.2 < 1.3; // true, float comparison\r\n\r\nbool eq8 = \"Hello\" < \"World\"; // true, string comparison\r\n```\r\n\r\n## If Statements\r\n\r\nConditionals in C++ are similar to conditionals in other languages.\r\nThe underlying type of any conditional operation is the `bool` type, which can have the value of `true` or `false`.\r\nConditionals are often used as flow control mechanisms to check for various conditions.\r\n\r\nAn `if` statement can be used, which executes its code if the underlying condition is `true` like this:\r\n\r\n```cpp\r\nstd::string value{\"val\"};\r\n\r\nif (value == \"val\") {\r\n    return \"was val\";\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn scenarios involving more than one case many `if` statements can be chained together using the `else if` and `else` statements.\r\n\r\n```cpp\r\nint number{33};\r\n\r\nif (number > 0) {\r\n   return \"positive\";\r\n} else if (number < 0) {\r\n    return \"negative\";\r\n} else {\r\n   return \"zero\";\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nSince C++17 if-statements can also include a short initialization statement that can be used to initialize one or more variables for the if statement.\r\nFor example:\r\n\r\n```cpp\r\nint num{7};\r\nif (int v{2 * num}; v > 10) {\r\n    return v;\r\n} else {\r\n    return num;\r\n}\r\n// => 14\r\n```\r\n\r\n> Note: any variables created in the initialization cannot be accessed after the end of the if statement.\r\n",
    "instructions": "# Instructions\r\n\r\nIn this exercise, you are going to write some code to help you prepare to buy a vehicle.\r\n\r\nYou have three tasks, one to determine if you need a license, one to help you choose between two vehicles, and one to estimate the acceptable price for a used vehicle.\r\n\r\n## 1. Determine if you will need a driver's license\r\n\r\nSome vehicle kinds require a driver's license to operate them.\r\nAssume only the kinds `\"car\"` and `\"truck\"` require a license, everything else can be operated without a license.\r\n\r\nImplement the `needs_license(kind)` function that takes the kind of vehicle as a string and returns a boolean indicating whether you need a license for that kind of vehicle.\r\n\r\n```cpp\r\nneeds_license(\"car\")\r\n// => true\r\n\r\nneeds_license(\"bike\")\r\n// => false\r\n\r\nneeds_license(\"truck\")\r\n// => true\r\n```\r\n\r\n## 2. Choose between two potential vehicles to buy\r\n\r\nYou evaluate your options of available vehicles.\r\nYou manage to narrow it down to two options but you need help making the final decision.\r\nFor that, implement the function `choose_vehicle(option1, option2)` that takes two vehicles as arguments and returns a decision that includes the option that comes first in lexicographical order.\r\n\r\n```cpp\r\nchoose_vehicle(\"Wuling Hongguang\", \"Toyota Corolla\")\r\n// => \"Toyota Corolla is clearly the better choice.\"\r\n\r\nchoose_vehicle(\"Volkswagen Beetle\", \"Volkswagen Golf\")\r\n// => \"Volkswagen Beetle is clearly the better choice.\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe returned string should follow the pattern of \"<CHOSEN_VEHICLE> is clearly the better choice.\", where `<CHOSEN_VEHICLE>` is the option of choice from the passed arguments.\r\n\r\n## 3. Calculate an estimation for the price of a used vehicle\r\n\r\nNow that you made a decision, you want to make sure you get a fair price at the dealership.\r\nSince you are interested in buying a used vehicle, the price depends on how old the vehicle is.\r\nFor a rough estimate, assume if the vehicle is less than 3 years old, it costs 80% of the original price it had when it was brand new.\r\nIf it is at least 10 years old, it costs 50%.\r\nIf the vehicle is at least 3 years old but less than 10 years, it costs 70% of the original price.\r\n\r\nImplement the `calculate_resell_price(original_price, age)` function that applies this logic using `if`, `else if` and `else` (there are other ways if you want to practice).\r\nIt takes the original price and the age of the vehicle as arguments and returns the estimated price in the dealership.\r\n\r\n```cpp\r\ncalculate_resell_price(1000, 1)\r\n// => 800\r\n\r\ncalculate_resell_price(1000, 5)\r\n// => 700\r\n\r\ncalculate_resell_price(1000.0, 15)\r\n// => 500\r\n```\r\n\r\n> Note: the return value is of type `double`.\r\n",
    "hints": "# Hints\r\n\r\n## 1. Determine if you will need a driver's license\r\n\r\n- Use the [equals comparison operator][comparison-operators] to check whether your input equals a certain string.\r\n- Use one of the two [logical operators][logical-operators] you learned about in the boolean concept to combine the two requirements.\r\n- You do **not** need an if-statement to solve this task. You can return the boolean expression you build directly.\r\n\r\n## 2. Choose between two potential vehicles to buy\r\n\r\n- Use a [comparison operator][comparison-operators] to determine which option comes first in lexicographical order.\r\n- Then set the value of a helper variable depending of the outcome of that comparison with the help of an an [if-else statement][if-statement].\r\n- Finally construct the recommendation sentence.\r\n  For that you can use the `+` operator to concatenate the two strings.\r\n\r\n## 3. Calculate an estimation for the price of a used vehicle\r\n\r\n- Start with determining the percentage of the original price based on the age of the vehicle.\r\n  Save it in a helper variable. Use an [if-else if-else statement][if-statement] as mentioned in the instructions.\r\n- In the two if conditions use [comparison operators][comparison-operators] to compare the age of the car to the threshold values.\r\n- To calculate the result, apply the percentage to the original price. For example `30% of x` can be calculated by dividing `30` by `100` and multiplying with `x`.\r\n\r\n[comparison-operators]: https://golang.org/ref/spec#Comparison_operators\r\n[logical-operators]: https://golang.org/ref/spec#Logical_operators\r\n[if-statement]: https://golang.org/ref/spec#If_statements\r\n"
