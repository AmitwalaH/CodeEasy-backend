    "introduction": "# Introduction\r\nThe built-in number types in C++ can be divided into integers and floating points.\r\nIntegers are whole numbers like `0`, `691`, or `-2`.\r\nFloating point numbers are numbers with a decimal point like `6.02214076`, `0.1`, or `-1.616`.\r\n\r\n## Integers\r\nThe following example shows the declaration and initialization of four different variables\r\n\r\n```cpp\r\nint m_morales{9241};              // base 10: 0-9\r\nint a_apaec{0x24CD};              // base 16: 0-9 and A-F\r\nint m_gargan{0b10010000011001};   // base  2: 0-1\r\nint b_reilly{022031};             // base  8: 0-7\r\n                                  // Leading with a 0 not the letter o.\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhen you assign a value to an `int` variable, you can do so directly with a literal.\r\nA literal is a hard-coded number like `9241`.\r\nThere are different integer literals for several bases of the representation.\r\nDecimal integer literals are the most common and use the digits `0` to `9`.\r\nBy adding a special prefix, like `0x`, it is possible to use other bases.\r\nThe example above shows the number `9241` in its four representations and prefixes.\r\nAll variables are initialized to the same value.\r\n\r\nFor more details on the different representation systems, take a look at [a small tutorial][cpp_numerical_bases].\r\n\r\nYou can use an apostrophe to separate digits for easier readability.\r\n`9'241` is the same as `0b0100'100'0001'1001` or `92'4'1`.\r\n\r\n## Floating-Point Numbers\r\n\r\nThe floating-point literals come in two flavors.\r\nIn addition to the intuitive `0.0024` it is possible to use its scientific notation `2.4e-3`.\r\nThe most common floating-point type is `double`.\r\n\r\n## Arithmetic\r\n\r\nC++ supports `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `(` and `)` and `%` to form expressions.\r\nThe result from the operation between two integers is also an integer.\r\n`5 / 2` will return `2`.\r\nWhen one of the involved types is a floating-point type, the result will also be of a floating-point.\r\n`5.0 / 2` and `5 / 2.0` will return `2.5`.\r\n`%` is the remainder operator and will return the remainder of an integer division: `5%3` is `2`.\r\n\r\n## Assignment operator\r\n\r\nThe assignment operator assigns a variable with a literal.\r\nAlways takes place from right to left, and never the other way around.\r\n\r\n```cpp\r\nint length = 5;\r\nint width = 2;\r\nlength = width;\r\n```\r\n\r\nHere integer value `5` is assigned to the variable `length`.\r\nThen integer value `2` is assigned to variable `width`.\r\nFinally value of `width` is copied to the variable `length` and the earlier value `5` will be lost.\r\nConsider also that we are only assigning the value of `width` to `length` at the moment of the assignment operation.\r\nTherefore, if the value of `width` changes at a later moment, it will not affect the value taken by `length`.\r\n\r\nAssignment operator can be combined with the other operators(arithmetic & bitwise) known as `compound assignment` operators `+=`, `-=`, `*=`, `/=`, `%=`.\r\nThese operators modify the current value of a variable by performing an operation on it.\r\n\r\n```cpp\r\n// we start with 0 people\r\nint people{};\r\n// we need 0 eggs\r\nint eggs{};\r\n// two people joined:\r\npeople += 2;\r\n// people is now 2\r\n// let's add 3 eggs per person\r\neggs += 3 * people;\r\n// eggs is now 6\r\n```\r\n\r\nVariables `people` & `eggs` are initialized to `0`.\r\nThen, we add integer value `2` over the existing value `0` of the variable `people` and assign it back to `people`.\r\n`people` becomes `2` now.\r\nLater, we add `3` eggs for each person, which turns out to be `6` eggs in total.\r\nNow add this `6` to existing value `0` of the variable `eggs` and assign it back to `eggs`.\r\n`eggs` will be `6` now.\r\nThe equivalent expression would be `people = people + 2` and `eggs = eggs + (3 * people)`.\r\n\r\n\r\n[cpp_numerical_bases]: https://cplusplus.com/doc/hex/\r\n",
    "instructions": "# Instructions\r\n\r\nIn this exercise, you'll be writing code to help a freelancer communicate with a project manager.\r\nYour task is to provide a few utilities to quickly calculate daily and monthly rates, optionally with a given discount.\r\n\r\nWe first establish a few rules between the freelancer and the project manager:\r\n\r\n- The daily rate is 8 times the hourly rate.\r\n- A month has 22 billable days.\r\n\r\nSometimes, the freelancer is offering to apply a discount on their daily rate (for example for their most loyal customers or not-for-profit customers).\r\n\r\nDiscounts are modeled as fractional numbers representing percentages, for example, `25.0` (25%).\r\n\r\n## 1. Calculate the daily rate given an hourly rate\r\n\r\nImplement a function called `daily_rate` to calculate the daily rate given an hourly rate as a parameter.\r\nThe contract defines that a day has 8 billable hours.\r\n\r\n```cpp\r\ndaily_rate(60)\r\n// => 480.0\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe returned daily rate should be of type `double`.\r\n\r\n## 2. Calculate a discounted price\r\n\r\nImplement a function `apply_discount` to calculate the price after a discount.\r\nIt should accept two parameters: the original price and the discount rate in percent.\r\n\r\n```cpp\r\napply_discount(150, 10)\r\n// => 135.0\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe returned value should always be of type `double`, not rounded in any way.\r\n\r\n## 3. Calculate the monthly rate, given an hourly rate and a discount\r\n\r\nImplement a `monthly_rate` function to calculate the discounted monthly rate.\r\nIt should have two parameters, an hourly rate and the discount in percent.\r\n\r\n```cpp\r\nmonthly_rate(77, 10.5)\r\n// => 12130\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe returned monthly rate should be rounded up (take the ceiling) to the nearest integer.\r\n\r\n## 4. Calculate the number of complete workdays given a budget, hourly rate, and discount\r\n\r\nImplement a function `days_in_budget` that takes a budget, an hourly rate, and a discount, and calculates how many complete days of work that covers.\r\n\r\n```cpp\r\ndays_in_budget(20'000, 80, 11.0)\r\n// => 35\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe returned number of days should be rounded down (take the floor) to the next integer.\r\n",
