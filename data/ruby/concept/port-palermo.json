    "introduction": "# About\r\n\r\n[Symbols][symbols] are named identifiers that can be used to refer to a value.\r\nSymbols are created through a symbol literal, which is by prefixing a name with a `:` character, e.g. `:foo`.\r\nThey also allow for being written with quotes, e.g. `:\"foo\"`, which allows, for example, spaces in the name.\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\n:foo # => :foo\r\n:\"foo boo\" # => :\"foo boo\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nSymbols are used in many places in the language, including as keys in hashes, to represent method names and variable names.\r\n\r\n## Identifier\r\n\r\nWhat makes symbols different from strings is that they are identifiers, and do not represent data or text.\r\nThis means that two symbols with the same name are always the same object.\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\n\"foo\".object_id # => 60\r\n\"foo\".object_id # => 80\r\n:foo.object_id # => 1086748\r\n:foo.object_id # => 1086748\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Modifying Symbols\r\n\r\nSymbols are immutable, which means that they cannot be modified.\r\nThis means that when you \"modify\" a symbol, you are actually creating a new symbol.\r\nThere are a few methods that can be used to manipulate symbols, they all return new symbols.\r\nAll methods can be found in the [Symbol API][symbols-api].\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\n:foo.upcase # => :FOO\r\n\r\n:foo.object_id # => 1086748\r\n:foo.upcase.object_id # => 60\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe benefit of symbols being immutable is that they are more memory efficient than strings, but also safer to use as identifiers.\r\n\r\n## Conversion\r\n\r\nSymbols can be converted to strings and vice versa.\r\nThis can be useful when you want to modify a symbol, or when you want to use a symbol as a string.\r\nTo present a string as a symbol, you can use the `String#to_sym` method, and to do the opposite, you can use the `Symbol#to_s` method.\r\nDue to symbols having a limited set of methods, it can be useful to convert a symbol to a string to use string methods on it, if a new symbol is needed.\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\n:foo.to_s # => \"foo\"\r\n\"foo\".to_sym # => :foo\r\n```\r\n\r\n[symbols]: https://www.rubyguides.com/2018/02/ruby-symbols/\r\n[symbols-api]: https://rubyapi.org/o/symbol\r\n",
    "instructions": "# Instructions\r\n\r\nThe port of Palermo is a busy harbor, with a lot of ships coming and going.\r\nIt has for a long time had a manual system for keeping track of the ships that are currently in the harbor.\r\nThis system is very error prone, and the harbor chief has decided to replace it with a computerized system.\r\n\r\nThe harbor chief has hired you to implement the new system.\r\nThe system has to handle identifiers for ships, but also for destinations.\r\n\r\n## 1. Create the ports identifier\r\n\r\nThe first thing you need to do is to create the identifier for the port of Palermo.\r\nThe identifier are the first four letters of the name of the port, in uppercase.\r\n\r\nDefine the `Port::IDENTIFIER` constant to be a symbol with the value `:PALE`.\r\n    \r\n```ruby\r\nPort::IDENTIFIER \r\n# => :PALE\r\n```\r\n\r\n## 2. Get identifiers for other ports\r\n\r\nThe program will also have to handle other ports, so you need to create identifiers for them as well.\r\nThe port would like the system to be automated and since ports uses different naming conventions, the identifiers should be generated from the name of the port.\r\nThe identifier are the first four letters of the name of the port, in uppercase.\r\n\r\nDefine the `Port.get_identifier` method to take a string as an argument, and returns the identifier as a symbol for that port.\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\nPort.get_identifier(\"Hamburg\") \r\n# => :HAMB\r\n```\r\n\r\n## 3. Determine which terminal a ship should dock at\r\n\r\nThe port has two terminals, and the system needs to determine which terminal a ship should dock at.\r\nThe terminal is determined by the identifier of the ship.\r\n\r\nThe identifier is built of 2 parts, the first part is made of 3 uppercased letters which says which cargo the ship is carrying, and then 3 numbers which is the unique identifier of the ship.\r\n\r\nIf the identifier of the ship is carrying: **OIL** or **GAS** the ship should dock at terminal **A**.\r\nElse the ship should dock at terminal **B**. \r\n\r\nDefine the `Port.get_terminal` method to take a symbol as an argument which is the identifier of the ship.\r\nThe method should return the terminal as a symbol.\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\nPort.get_terminal(:OIL123)\r\n# => :A\r\n```\r\n",
