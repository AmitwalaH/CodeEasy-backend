    "introduction": "# Introduction\r\n\r\n## Arrays\r\n\r\nIn Ruby, **arrays** are ordered, integer-indexed collections of any object.\r\nArray indexing starts at `0`.\r\nA negative index is assumed to be relative to the end of the array — e.g.. an index of `-1` indicates the last element of the array, `-2` is the next to last element in the array, and so on.\r\n\r\n### Creating arrays\r\n\r\nArrays are normally created using the `[]` notation.\r\nThey can contain any different type of object.\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\narray = [1, \"two\", 3.0]\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Element Reference\r\n\r\nElements in an array can be retrieved by their indexes using the `#[]` method.\r\nThis returns the element at index, or returns a subarray starting at the start index and continuing for a specified length.\r\nNegative indices count backward from the end of the array.\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\na = [ \"a\", \"b\", \"c\", \"d\", \"e\" ]\r\n\r\na[2]       #=> \"c\"\r\na[6]       #=> nil\r\na[1, 3]    #=> [ \"b\", \"c\", \"d\" ]\r\n\r\na[-1]      #=> \"e\"\r\na[-2]      #=> \"d\"\r\na[-3, 2]   #=> [\"c\", \"d\"]\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Helper Methods\r\n\r\nThere are lots of useful helper methods on arrays.\r\nHere are some of the more common:\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\nfibonacci = [0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13]\r\n\r\nfibonacci.size      #=> 8\r\nfibonacci.sum       #=> 33\r\nfibonacci.reverse   #=> [13, 8, 5, 3, 2, 1, 1, 0]\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Enumeration\r\n\r\nRather than using loops to iterate through collections, in Ruby we use enumeration.\r\n\r\nEnumeration is the act of stepping through a collection (in this case an array) and performing some action on each object.  Enumeration is a key concept in Ruby and is used for things like sorting, grouping, mapping, reducing, and much more.\r\n\r\nAn enumeration to print each word in an array would look like this:\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\nwords = [\"the\", \"cat\", \"sat\"]\r\nwords.each do |word|\r\n  puts word\r\nend\r\n\r\n# Output:\r\n# the\r\n# cat\r\n# sat\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn this example, we have called the `.each` method on our array and passed in a _block_ that takes one parameter (`word`) and prints it out.\r\n\r\nWe'll look at _blocks_ in much more depth later in the Track, but for now think of them as anonymous functions that can take zero or more arguments.\r\nThey can be defined using the `do...end` syntax (above), or the `{}` syntax (below).\r\n\r\nHere are some other examples of array methods that use blocks:\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\nfibonacci = [0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13]\r\n\r\nfibonacci.count  { |number| number == 1 }   #=> 2\r\nfibonacci.any?   { |number| number == 6 }   #=> false\r\nfibonacci.select { |number| number.odd? }   #=> [1, 1, 3, 5, 13]\r\nfibonacci.all?   { |number| number < 20 }   #=> true\r\nfibonacci.map    { |number| number * 2  }   #=> [0, 2, 2, 4, 6, 10, 16, 26]\r\n```\r\n",
    "instructions": "# Instructions\r\n\r\nYou're an avid bird watcher that keeps track of how many birds have visited your garden in the last seven days.\r\n\r\nYou have five tasks, all dealing with the numbers of birds that visited your garden.\r\n\r\n## 1. Check what the counts were last week\r\n\r\nFor comparison purposes, you always keep a copy of last week's counts nearby, which were: 0, 2, 5, 3, 7, 8 and 4. Implement the `BirdCount.last_week` method that returns last week's counts:\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\nBirdCount.last_week\r\n# => [0, 2, 5, 3, 7, 8, 4]\r\n```\r\n\r\n## 2. Check how many birds visited yesterday\r\n\r\nImplement the `BirdCount#yesterday` method to return how many birds visited your garden yesterday. The bird counts are ordered by day, with the first element being the count of the oldest day, and the last element being today's count.\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\nbirds_per_day = [2, 5, 0, 7, 4, 1]\r\nbird_count = BirdCount.new(birds_per_day)\r\nbird_count.yesterday\r\n# => 4\r\n```\r\n\r\n## 3. Calculate the total number of visiting birds\r\n\r\nImplement the `BirdCount#total` method to return the total number of birds that have visited your garden:\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\nbirds_per_day = [2, 5, 0, 7, 4, 1]\r\nbird_count = BirdCount.new(birds_per_day)\r\nbird_count.total\r\n# => 19\r\n```\r\n\r\n## 4. Calculate the number of busy days\r\n\r\nSome days are busier than others. A busy day is one where five or more birds have visited your garden.\r\nImplement the `BirdCount#busy_days` method to return the number of busy days:\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\nbirds_per_day = [2, 5, 0, 7, 4, 1]\r\nbird_count = BirdCount.new(birds_per_day)\r\nbird_count.busy_days\r\n# => 2\r\n```\r\n\r\n## 5. Check if there was a day with no visiting birds\r\n\r\nImplement the `BirdCount#day_without_birds?` method that returns `true` if there was a day at which zero birds visited the garden; otherwise, return `false`:\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\nbirds_per_day = [2, 5, 0, 7, 4, 1]\r\nbird_count = BirdCount.new(birds_per_day)\r\nbird_count.day_without_birds?\r\n# => true\r\n```\r\n",
    "hints": "# Hints\r\n\r\n## General\r\n\r\n- The bird count per day is stored in a [instance variable][instance-variables] named `birds_per_day`.\r\n- The bird count per day is an array that contains exactly 7 integers.\r\n\r\n## 1. Check what the counts were last week\r\n\r\n- As this method does _not_ depend on the current week's count, it is defined as a [`class` method][class-method].\r\n- There are [several ways to define an array][array-definition].\r\n\r\n## 2. Check how many birds visited yesterday\r\n\r\n- Remember that the counts are ordered by day from oldest to most recent, with the last element representing today.\r\n- Accessing the second last element can be done either by using its (fixed) index (remember to start counting from zero) or by calculating its index using the [array's size][array-length].\r\n\r\n## 3. Calculate the total number of visiting birds\r\n\r\n- It's possible to calculate the sum of a collection using the [Array#sum][array-sum] method.\r\n\r\n## 4. Calculate the number of busy days\r\n\r\n- Ruby also provides a method for [counting elements on a collection][array-count]\r\n\r\n## 5. Check if there was a day with no visiting birds\r\n\r\n- There are some methods that can be use to check the existence on an element on a collection. For example [Enumerable#any?][enumerable-any] and [Enumerable#all?][enumerable-all]\r\n\r\n[instance-variables]: http://ruby-for-beginners.rubymonstas.org/writing_classes/instance_variables.html\r\n[class-method]: http://www.rubyfleebie.com/2007/04/09/understanding-class-methods-in-ruby/\r\n[array-definition]: https://ruby-doc.org/core-2.7.0/Array.html#class-Array-label-Creating+Arrays\r\n[array-length]: https://ruby-doc.org/core-2.7.0/Array.html#class-Array-label-Obtaining+Information+about+an+Array\r\n[array-sum]: https://ruby-doc.org/core-2.7.0/Array.html#method-i-sum\r\n[array-count]: https://ruby-doc.org/core-2.7.0/Array.html#method-i-count\r\n[enumerable-any]: https://ruby-doc.org/core-2.7.0/Enumerable.html#method-i-any-3F\r\n[enumerable-all]: https://ruby-doc.org/core-2.7.0/Enumerable.html#method-i-all-3F\r\n"
