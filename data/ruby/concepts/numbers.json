    "about": "# About\r\n\r\nOne of the key aspects of working with numbers in Ruby is the distinction between integers (numbers with no digits after the decimal separator) and floating-point numbers (numbers with zero or more digits after the decimal separator).\r\nThey are implemented through the [`Integer`][integer-ruby] and [`Float`][float-ruby] class.\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\na = 1\r\nb = 1.0\r\na.class\r\n#=> Integer\r\nb.class\r\n#=> Float\r\n```\r\n\r\n- Arithmetic is done using the basic [arithmetic operators][arithmetic-operators] (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`). Numbers can be compared using the standard [comparison operators][comparison-operators].\r\n- Basic arithmetic operations between instances of `Integer`, will always result in an instance of `Integer`.\r\n- Basic arithmetic operations between instances of `Float` will result in other instances of `Float`.\r\n- Basic arithmetic operations between instances of `Integer` and instances of `Float` will result in instances of `Float`.\r\n- The `Float` and `Integer` classes have methods that will coerce values from one to the other. `Integer` numbers are precise to a whole unit, while `Float` has precision that is fractional to an whole number. This means that coercing a float to an integer may result in loss of precision.\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\n4.9.to_i\r\n#=> 4\r\n\r\n5.to_f\r\n#=> 5.0\r\n\r\n7 - 3.0\r\n#=> 4.0\r\n\r\n2 == 4\r\n#=> false\r\n\r\n1.0 == 1\r\n#=> true\r\n```\r\n\r\nAn `if` statement can be used to conditionally execute code:\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\nx = 5\r\n\r\nif x == 5\r\n  # Execute logic if x equals 5\r\nelsif x > 7\r\n  # Execute logic if x greater than 7\r\nelse\r\n  # Execute logic in all other cases\r\nend\r\n```\r\n\r\nSometimes you want to execute a statement (or statements) if a condition is _not_ true, for situations like that, Ruby implements the `unless` keyword:\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\nx = 4\r\nunless x == 5\r\n  # Execute logic if x does not equal 5\r\nelse\r\n  # Execute logic if x == 5\r\nend\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf you want to execute different code depending on the value of a variable, Ruby's `case` statement might come useful:\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\ny = 5\r\ncase y\r\nwhen 3\r\n  # Execute logic if y equals 3\r\nwhen 5\r\n  # Execute logic if y equals 5\r\nelse\r\n  # Execute logic in all other cases\r\nend\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe same problem can sometimes be solved using different types of conditional statements, sometimes one might be more suited for the problem than the other. It's a good idea to stop for a moment and also consider the other two options when using any of the three conditional statements.\r\n\r\n[arithmetic-operators]: https://www.tutorialspoint.com/ruby/ruby_operators.htm\r\n[comparison-operators]: https://www.w3resource.com/ruby/ruby-comparison-operators.php\r\n[if-else-unless]: https://www.w3resource.com/ruby/ruby-if-else-unless.php\r\n[integer-ruby]: https://ruby-doc.org/core-2.7.1/Integer.html\r\n[float-ruby]: https://ruby-doc.org/core-2.7.1/Float.html\r\n",
    "introduction": "# Introduction\r\n\r\nTwo common types of numbers in Ruby are:\r\n\r\n- Integers: numbers with no digits behind the decimal separator (whole numbers). Examples are `-6`, `0`, `1`, `25`, `976` and `500_000`.\r\n- Floating-point numbers: numbers with zero or more digits behind the decimal separator. Examples are `-2.4`, `0.1`, `3.14`, `16.984025` and `1024.0`, (they also can use the `_` as a separator for readability as shown above such as `1_024.0`).\r\n\r\nThey are implemented through the `Integer` and `Float` classes.\r\n\r\nThe `Float` and `Integer` classes have methods that will coerce values from one to the other. `Integer` numbers are precise to a whole unit, while `Float` has precision that is fractional to a whole number.\r\n"
