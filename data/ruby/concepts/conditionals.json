=> -1\r\n2 <=> 2 # => 0\r\n3 <=> 2 # => 1\r\n```\r\n\r\n## If statement\r\n\r\nThe [`if`][if] statement is used to check if a given condition is \"truthy\" or \"falsey\".\r\nIf the condition is truthy then the code inside the if statement will run.\r\nAn `if` statement ends with the `end` keyword.\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\nvalue = 1\r\nif value == 1\r\n  \"1 is equal to 1\"\r\nend\r\n# => \"1 is equal to 1\"\r\n\r\nif value > 2\r\n  \"1 is greater than 2\"\r\nend\r\n# => nil\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Unless statement\r\n\r\nThe `unless` statement works very similarly to the `if` statement but it will run the code inside the `unless` statement if the condition is falsey.\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\nvalue = 1\r\nunless value == 1\r\n  \"1 is not equal to 1\"\r\nend\r\n# => nil\r\n\r\nunless value > 2\r\n  \"1 is not greater than 2\"\r\nend\r\n# => \"1 is not greater than 2\"\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Else statement\r\n\r\nThe `else` statement can be used in conjunction with the `if` statement.\r\nThe `else` statement will be executed if the `if` branch is not executed.\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\nvalue = 1\r\nif value == 1\r\n  \"1 is equal to 1\"\r\nelse\r\n  \"1 is not equal to 1\"\r\nend\r\n# => \"1 is equal to 1\"\r\n\r\nif value > 2\r\n  \"1 is greater than 2\"\r\nelse\r\n  \"1 is not greater than 2\"\r\nend\r\n# => \"1 is not greater than 2\"\r\n```\r\n\r\n## \"Cascading-if\" statements\r\n\r\nThe `elsif` statement can be used in conjunction with the if statement.\r\nThe `elsif` statement will be executed if the if branch is not executed and the condition of the elsif statement is truthy.\r\nElsif statements can be chained together and the first truthy condition will be executed.\r\nThere can also be an else statement at the end of the if statement which will run if none of the earlier statements have been true.\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\nvalue = 1\r\nif value == 0\r\n  \"1 is equal to 0\"\r\nelsif value > 2\r\n  \"1 is greater than 2\"\r\nelse\r\n  \"1 is not equal to 0 and 1 is not greater than 2\"\r\nend\r\n# => \"1 is not equal to 0 and 1 is not greater than 2\"\r\n```\r\n\r\n## if and unless as suffix\r\n\r\nThe if and unless statement can also be used as a [suffix][if-as-suffix], this is useful when you want to run a single line of code if a condition is true.\r\nIt is done by putting the if or unless statement after the code that you want to run.\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\nvalue = 1\r\n\"1 is equal to 1\" if value == 1\r\n# => 1 is equal to 1\r\n\r\n\"1 is not equal to 1\" unless value == 1\r\n# => nil\r\n```\r\n\r\n[comparison-operators]: https://www.w3resource.com/ruby/ruby-comparison-operators.php\r\n[if]: https://www.rubyguides.com/ruby-tutorial/ruby-if-else/\r\n",
