    "about": "# About\r\n\r\nRuby is a dynamic and strongly typed language. In dynamic languages the type of a variable or object is resolved at runtime, which means that its value or type can be changed up to the very last moment (when it gets parsed by the interpreter).\r\nAnd what do we mean with strongly typed? Once we know the type of a variable or object, Ruby is strict about what you can do with it, for example:\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\nx = '2'\r\ny = x + 'n'\r\n# =>  '2n'\r\n```\r\n\r\n**But**\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\nx = '2'\r\ny = x + 2\r\n# => TypeError (no implicit conversion of Integer into String)\r\n```\r\n\r\nRemember, in Ruby everything is an object. Even classes are instances of the class `Class`. For example:\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\n1.class\r\n# => Integer\r\n\r\nInteger.is_a?(Object)\r\n# => true\r\n\r\nClass.is_a?(Object)\r\n# => true\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis means that we can also define classes like this:\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\nCar = Class.new do\r\n  def run\r\n    'running'\r\n  end\r\nend\r\n\r\nCar.new.run\r\n# => 'running'\r\n```\r\n\r\nFinally, bear in mind that the `Integer` object holds values that may be defined as one or more (consecutive) digits and its methods support many of the [mathematical operators][integers-docs].\r\n\r\n[integers-docs]: https://ruby-doc.org/core-2.7.0/Integer.html\r\n\r\n~~~~exercism/note\r\nThe communication in documentation often will reference instance methods using syntax like `Class#method_name` while class or module level methods are referenced as `Class::method_name`.\r\nThe `::` is called the _Scope Resolution Operator_, the constant or method at the class or module level being referenced.\r\nYou will encounter this in the Ruby documentation, and in mailing lists and other support areas.\r\nYou will find that we reference class and module methods in our writing as `ClassName.method_name` or `ModuleName.method_name`, instead.\r\n~~~~\r\n",
    "introduction": "# Introduction\r\n\r\nRuby is a dynamic [object-oriented language][object-oriented-programming]. Everything in Ruby is an [object][object].\r\n\r\nThere are two primary ways to assign objects to names in Ruby - using variables or constants. Variables are always written in [snake case][snake-case]. A variable can reference different objects over its lifetime. For example, `my_first_variable` can be defined and redefined many times using the `=` operator:\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\nmy_first_variable = 1\r\nmy_first_variable = \"Some string\"\r\nmy_first_variable = SomeComplexObject.new\r\n```\r\n\r\nConstants, however, are meant to be assigned once. They must start with capital letters and are normally written in block capitals with words separated by underscores. For example:\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\nMY_FIRST_CONSTANT = 10\r\n\r\n# Redefining not allowed\r\n# MY_FIRST_CONSTANT = \"Some String\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nRuby is organised into classes. Classes are defined using the `class` keyword followed by the name of the class. Objects are generally created by instantiating classes using the `.new` method. For example:\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\n# Define the class\r\nclass Calculator\r\n  #...\r\nend\r\n\r\n# Create an instance of it and assign it to a variable\r\nmy_first_calc = Calculator.new\r\n```\r\n\r\nUnits of functionality are encapsulated in methods - similar to _functions_ in other languages. A method can optionally be defined with positional arguments, and/or keyword arguments that are defined and called using the `:` syntax. Methods either implicitly return the result of the last evaluated statement, or can explicitly return an object via the `return` keyword. Methods are invoked using `.` syntax.\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\nclass Calculator\r\n\r\n  # Unnamed params\r\n  def add(num1, num2)\r\n    return num1 + num2 # Explicit return\r\n  end\r\n\r\n  # Named params\r\n  def multiply(num1:, num2:)\r\n    num1 * num2 # Implicit return\r\n  end\r\nend\r\n\r\ncalc = Calculator.new\r\ncalc.add(1, 3)\r\ncalc.multiply(num1: 2, num2: 5)\r\n```\r\n\r\n[object-oriented-programming]: https://ruby-doc.org/docs/ruby-doc-bundle/UsersGuide/rg/oothinking.html\r\n[object]: https://github.com/exercism/v3/blob/main/reference/concepts/objects.md\r\n[snake-case]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snake_case\r\n"
