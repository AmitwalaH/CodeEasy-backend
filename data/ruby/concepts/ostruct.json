Rather than having to access using `Hash` keys, `OpenStruct` instead allows us to use methods to access and set values.\r\n\r\nWhen using classes from the Standard Library, or any other library, you need to require that class using the `require` method.\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\nrequire 'ostruct'\r\n\r\nattributes = { name: \"Jeremy Walker\", age: 21, location: \"Nomadic\" }\r\nperson = OpenStruct.new(attributes)\r\n\r\nperson.name\r\n#=> Jeremy Walker\r\n\r\nperson.location\r\n#=> Nomadic\r\n\r\n# Update the age\r\nperson.age = 35\r\n\r\n# It sets correctly\r\nperson.age\r\n#=> 35\r\n```\r\n\r\nOne bonus advantage of this is that you can take advantage of a shortcut when using block syntax. In situations where a block calls a single method, you can replace the block with `&:` followed by the method name. For example, these two lines are synonymous:\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\npeople.sum { |person| person.age }\r\npeople.sum(&:age)\r\n```\r\n\r\n",
