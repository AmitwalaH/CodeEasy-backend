In Ruby, floating-point numbers are implemented through the [Float](https://ruby-doc.org/core-2.7.0/Float.html) class.\r\n\r\nYou can find a short introduction to floating-point numbers at [0.30000000000000004.com][0.30000000000000004.com].\r\n\r\nThe [Float Toy page][evanw.github.io-float-toy] has a nice, graphical explanation how a floating-point numbers' bits are converted to an actual floating-point value.\r\n\r\nTo repeatedly execute logic, one can use loops. In this example the `while` loop is useful because it keeps on looping _while_ a condition evaluates to some truthy value (i.e. not `false` or `nil`). Ruby implements a loop similar to the `while` loop. It's called the `until` loop, and you've probably guessed what it does. It keeps looping _until_ a boolean condition evaluates to `true`. In some languages, to make a piece of code execute an unlimited number of times, constructs like `while true` are used. In Ruby, the `loop` loop exists for that purpose. Even though the `loop` loop does not depend on a single condition, it can be canceled by using a `return` or `break` keyword.\r\n\r\nThe `#years_before_desired_balance` method from the previous exercise could have been written by using any of the three mentioned loops:\r\n\r\n## `while`\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\ndef self.years_before_desired_balance(current_balance, desired_balance)\r\n  years = 0\r\n  while current_balance < desired_balance\r\n    current_balance = annual_balance_update(current_balance)\r\n    years += 1\r\n  end\r\n  years\r\nend\r\n```\r\n\r\n## `until`\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\ndef self.years_before_desired_balance(current_balance, desired_balance)\r\n  years = 0\r\n  until current_balance >= desired_balance\r\n    current_balance = annual_balance_update(current_balance)\r\n    years += 1\r\n  end\r\n  years\r\nend\r\n```\r\n\r\n## `loop`\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\ndef self.years_before_desired_balance(current_balance, desired_balance)\r\n  years = 0\r\n  loop do\r\n    current_balance = annual_balance_update(current_balance)\r\n    years += 1\r\n    return years if current_balance >= desired_balance\r\n  end\r\nend\r\n```\r\n\r\nAs you have probably noticed, Ruby has no increment operator (`i++`) like some other languages do. Instead, constructs like `i += 1` (which is equal to `i = i + 1`) can be used.\r\n\r\n[0.30000000000000004.com]: https://0.30000000000000004.com/\r\n[evanw.github.io-float-toy]: https://evanw.github.io/float-toy/\r\n",
