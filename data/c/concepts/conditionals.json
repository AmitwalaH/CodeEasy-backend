5: j;\r\n```\r\n\r\nTernary operators can be nested to reduce syntactic clutter.\r\n\r\n```c\r\n// the below could also be \r\ni = j > 5 ? j :k > 5 ? k: 10;\r\n// but that may not be quite as readable\r\n\r\ni = j > 5 ? j\r\n    :k > 5 ? k\r\n    :10;\r\n\r\n// which is the same as\r\nif (j > 5) i = j;\r\nelse if (k > 5) i = k;\r\nelse i = 10;\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Conditional Comparisons for Floating Point Values\r\n\r\nBecause of how floating point numbers are implemented, a simple math operation may result in a rounding error which can cause a test for equality to not return the expected result.\r\n\r\n```c\r\n    a = 1.345f;\r\n    b = 1.123f;\r\n    c = a + b;\r\n    // c may equal something like 2.4679999352\r\n    if (c == 2.468)\r\n        return \"I won the lottery!\";\r\n```\r\n\r\nA tolerance value, referred to as `epsilon`, can be used to determine a range within which a value can fall to still be considered equal when compared with another value.\r\nSome platforms have built-in constants for float and double epsilons.\r\nRefer to the documentation for your compiler to learn more.\r\nCalculating the epsilon can be sophisticated and may vary between platforms: even between individual machines.\r\nHere is an example program using a simple comparison.\r\n\r\n```c\r\n#include <stdio.h>\r\n#include <math.h>\r\n#include <stdbool.h>\r\n\r\nconst double MY_EPSILON = .002;\r\n\r\nbool same(double x, double y)\r\n{\r\n    return fabs(x - y) < MY_EPSILON;\r\n}\r\n\r\nint main()\r\n{\r\n    // Same should return true if the difference is less than MY_EPSILON\r\n    printf(\"%s\\n\", same(1.1, 1.099) ? \"true\" : \"false\"); // prints true\r\n    printf(\"%s\\n\", same(1.1, 1.098) ? \"true\" : \"false\"); // prints false\r\n    return 0;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nBe wary when comparing `float`s or `double`s for equality!\r\n",
