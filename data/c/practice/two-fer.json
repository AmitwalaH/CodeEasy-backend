    "introduction": "# Introduction\r\n\r\nIn some English accents, when you say \"two for\" quickly, it sounds like \"two fer\".\r\nTwo-for-one is a way of saying that if you buy one, you also get one for free.\r\nSo the phrase \"two-fer\" often implies a two-for-one offer.\r\n\r\nImagine a bakery that has a holiday offer where you can buy two cookies for the price of one (\"two-fer one!\").\r\nYou take the offer and (very generously) decide to give the extra cookie to someone else in the queue.\r\n",
    "instructions": "# Instructions\r\n\r\nYour task is to determine what you will say as you give away the extra cookie.\r\n\r\nIf you know the person's name (e.g. if they're named Do-yun), then you will say:\r\n\r\n```text\r\nOne for Do-yun, one for me.\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf you don't know the person's name, you will say _you_ instead.\r\n\r\n```text\r\nOne for you, one for me.\r\n```\r\n\r\nHere are some examples:\r\n\r\n| Name   | Dialogue                    |\r\n| :----- | :-------------------------- |\r\n| Alice  | One for Alice, one for me.  |\r\n| Bohdan | One for Bohdan, one for me. |\r\n|        | One for you, one for me.    |\r\n| Zaphod | One for Zaphod, one for me. |\r\n",
