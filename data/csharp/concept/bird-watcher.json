    "introduction": "# Introduction\r\n\r\n## Arrays\r\n\r\nIn C#, data structures that can hold zero or more elements are known as _collections_. An **array** is a collection that has a fixed size/length and whose elements must all be of the same type. Elements can be assigned to an array or retrieved from it using an index. C# arrays are zero-based, meaning that the first element's index is always zero:\r\n\r\n```csharp\r\n// Declare array with explicit size (size is 2)\r\nint[] twoInts = new int[2];\r\n\r\n// Assign second element by index\r\ntwoInts[1] = 8;\r\n\r\n// Retrieve the second element by index\r\ntwoInts[1] == 8; // => true\r\n```\r\n\r\nArrays can also be defined using a shortcut notation that allows you to both create the array and set its value. As the compiler can now tell how many elements the array will have, the length can be omitted:\r\n\r\n```csharp\r\n// Three equivalent ways to declare and initialize an array (size is 3)\r\nint[] threeIntsV1 = new int[] { 4, 9, 7 };\r\nint[] threeIntsV2 = new[] { 4, 9, 7 };\r\nint[] threeIntsV3 = { 4, 9, 7 };\r\n```\r\n\r\nArrays can be manipulated by either calling an array instance's methods or properties, or by using the static methods defined in the `Array` class.\r\n\r\n## For Loops\r\n\r\nA `for` loop allows one to repeatedly execute code in a loop until a condition is met.\r\n\r\n```csharp\r\nfor (int i = 0; i < 5; i++)\r\n{\r\n    System.Console.Write(i);\r\n}\r\n\r\n// => 01234\r\n```\r\n\r\nA `for` loop consists of four parts:\r\n\r\n1. The initializer: executed once before entering the loop. Usually used to define variables used within the loop.\r\n2. The condition: executed before each loop iteration. The loop continues to execute while this evaluates to `true`.\r\n3. The iterator: execute after each loop iteration. Usually used to modify (often: increment/decrement) the loop variable(s).\r\n4. The body: the code that gets executed each loop iteration.\r\n\r\n## Foreach Loops\r\n\r\nThe fact that an array is also a _collection_ means that, besides accessing values by index, you can iterate over _all_ its values using a `foreach` loop:\r\n\r\n```csharp\r\nchar[] vowels = new [] { 'a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u' };\r\n\r\nforeach (char vowel in vowels)\r\n{\r\n    // Output the vowel\r\n    System.Console.Write(vowel);\r\n}\r\n\r\n// => aeiou\r\n```\r\n",
    "instructions": "# Instructions\r\n\r\nYou're an avid bird watcher that keeps track of how many birds have visited your garden in the last seven days.\r\n\r\nYou have six tasks, all dealing with the numbers of birds that visited your garden.\r\n\r\n## 1. Check what the counts were last week\r\n\r\nFor comparison purposes, you always keep a copy of last week's counts nearby, which were: 0, 2, 5, 3, 7, 8 and 4. Implement the (_static_) `BirdCount.LastWeek()` method that returns last week's counts:\r\n\r\n```csharp\r\nBirdCount.LastWeek();\r\n// => [0, 2, 5, 3, 7, 8, 4]\r\n```\r\n\r\n## 2. Check how many birds visited today\r\n\r\nImplement the `BirdCount.Today()` method to return how many birds visited your garden today. The bird counts are ordered by day, with the first element being the count of the oldest day, and the last element being today's count.\r\n\r\n```csharp\r\nint[] birdsPerDay = { 2, 5, 0, 7, 4, 1 };\r\nvar birdCount = new BirdCount(birdsPerDay);\r\nbirdCount.Today();\r\n// => 1\r\n```\r\n\r\n## 3. Increment today's count\r\n\r\nImplement the `BirdCount.IncrementTodaysCount()` method to increment today's count:\r\n\r\n```csharp\r\nint[] birdsPerDay = { 2, 5, 0, 7, 4, 1 };\r\nvar birdCount = new BirdCount(birdsPerDay);\r\nbirdCount.IncrementTodaysCount();\r\nbirdCount.Today();\r\n// => 2\r\n```\r\n\r\n## 4. Check if there was a day with no visiting birds\r\n\r\nImplement the `BirdCount.HasDayWithoutBirds()` method that returns `true` if there was a day at which zero birds visited the garden; otherwise, return `false`:\r\n\r\n```csharp\r\nint[] birdsPerDay = { 2, 5, 0, 7, 4, 1 };\r\nvar birdCount = new BirdCount(birdsPerDay);\r\nbirdCount.HasDayWithoutBirds();\r\n// => true\r\n```\r\n\r\n## 5. Calculate the number of visiting birds for the first number of days\r\n\r\nImplement the `BirdCount.CountForFirstDays()` method that returns the number of birds that have visited your garden from the start of the week, but limit the count to the specified number of days from the start of the week.\r\n\r\n```csharp\r\nint[] birdsPerDay = { 2, 5, 0, 7, 4, 1 };\r\nvar birdCount = new BirdCount(birdsPerDay);\r\nbirdCount.CountForFirstDays(4);\r\n// => 14\r\n```\r\n\r\n## 6. Calculate the number of busy days\r\n\r\nSome days are busier than others. A busy day is one where five or more birds have visited your garden.\r\nImplement the `BirdCount.BusyDays()` method to return the number of busy days:\r\n\r\n```csharp\r\nint[] birdsPerDay = { 2, 5, 0, 7, 4, 1 };\r\nvar birdCount = new BirdCount(birdsPerDay);\r\nbirdCount.BusyDays();\r\n// => 2\r\n```\r\n",
    "hints": "# Hints\r\n\r\n## General\r\n\r\n- The bird count per day is stored in a [field][fields] named `birdsPerDay`.\r\n- The bird count per day is an array that contains exactly 7 integers.\r\n\r\n## 1. Check what the counts were last week\r\n\r\n- As this method does _not_ depend on the current week's count, it is defined as a [`static` method][static-members].\r\n- There are [several ways to define an array][single-dimensional-arrays].\r\n\r\n## 2. Check how many birds visited today\r\n\r\n- Remember that the counts are ordered by day from oldest to most recent, with the last element representing today.\r\n- Accessing the last element can be done either by using its (fixed) index (remember to start counting from zero) or by calculating its index using the [array's size][array-length].\r\n\r\n## 3. Increment today's count\r\n\r\n- Set the element representing today's count to today's count plus 1.\r\n\r\n## 4. Check if there was a day with no visiting birds\r\n\r\n- The `Array` class has a [built-in method][array-indexof] that returns the first index where the element is found, or -1 if no matching element was found.\r\n\r\n## 5. Calculate the number of visiting birds for the first number of days\r\n\r\n- A variable can be used to hold the count for the number of visiting birds.\r\n- The array can be iterated over using a [`for` loop][for-statement].\r\n- The variable can be updated inside the loop.\r\n- Remember: arrays are indexed from `0`.\r\n\r\n## 6. Calculate the number of busy days\r\n\r\n- A variable can be used to hold the number of busy days.\r\n- The array can be iterated over using a [`foreach` loop][array-foreach].\r\n- The variable can be updated inside the loop.\r\n- A [conditional statement][if-statement] can be used inside the loop.\r\n\r\n[array-foreach]: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/programming-guide/arrays/using-foreach-with-arrays\r\n[single-dimensional-arrays]: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/programming-guide/arrays/single-dimensional-arrays\r\n[fields]: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/programming-guide/classes-and-structs/fields\r\n[static-members]: https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/programming-c/0596001177/ch04s03.html\r\n[array-indexof]: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.array.indexof\r\n[if-statement]: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/keywords/if-else\r\n[array-length]: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.array.length\r\n[for-statement]: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/keywords/for\r\n"
