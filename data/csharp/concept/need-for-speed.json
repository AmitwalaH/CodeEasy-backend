    "introduction": "# Introduction\r\n\r\n## Constructors\r\n\r\nCreating an instance of a _class_ is done by calling its _constructor_ through the `new` operator. A constructor is a special type of method whose goal is to initialize a newly created instance. Constructors look like regular methods, but without a return type and with a name that matches the classes' name.\r\n\r\n```csharp\r\nclass Library\r\n{\r\n    private int books;\r\n\r\n    public Library()\r\n    {\r\n        // Initialize the books field\r\n        this.books = 10;\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n\r\n// This will call the constructor\r\nvar library = new Library();\r\n```\r\n\r\nLike regular methods, constructors can have parameters. Constructor parameters are usually stored as (private) fields to be accessed later, or else used in some one-off calculation. Arguments can be passed to constructors just like passing arguments to regular methods.\r\n\r\n```csharp\r\nclass Building\r\n{\r\n    private int numberOfStories;\r\n    private int totalHeight;\r\n\r\n    public Building(int numberOfStories, double storyHeight)\r\n    {\r\n        this.numberOfStories = numberOfStories;\r\n        this.totalHeight = numberOfStories * storyHeight;\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n\r\n// Call a constructor with two arguments\r\nvar largeBuilding = new Building(55, 6.2)\r\n```\r\n",
    "instructions": "# Instructions\r\n\r\nIn this exercise you'll be organizing races between various types of remote controlled cars. Each car has its own speed and battery drain characteristics.\r\n\r\nCars start with full (100%) batteries. Each time you drive the car using the remote control, it covers the car's speed in meters and decreases the remaining battery percentage by its battery drain.\r\n\r\nIf a car's battery is below its battery drain percentage, you can't drive the car anymore.\r\n\r\nEach race track has its own distance. Cars are tested by checking if they can finish the track without running out of battery.\r\n\r\nYou have six tasks, each of which will work with remote controller car instances.\r\n\r\n## 1. Creating a remote controlled car\r\n\r\nAllow creating a remote controller car by defining a constructor for the `RemoteControlCar` class that takes the speed of the car in meters and the battery drain percentage as its two parameters (both of type `int`):\r\n\r\n```csharp\r\nint speed = 5;\r\nint batteryDrain = 2;\r\nvar car = new RemoteControlCar(speed, batteryDrain);\r\n```\r\n\r\n## 2. Creating a race track\r\n\r\nAllow creating a race track by defining a constructor for the `RaceTrack` class that takes the track's distance in meters as its sole parameter (which is of type `int`):\r\n\r\n```csharp\r\nint distance = 800;\r\nvar raceTrack = new RaceTrack(distance);\r\n```\r\n\r\n## 3. Drive the car\r\n\r\nImplement the `RemoteControlCar.Drive()` method that updates the number of meters driven based on the car's speed. Also implement the `RemoteControlCar.DistanceDriven()` method to return the number of meters driven by the car:\r\n\r\n```csharp\r\nint speed = 5;\r\nint batteryDrain = 2;\r\nvar car = new RemoteControlCar(speed, batteryDrain);\r\ncar.Drive();\r\n\r\ncar.DistanceDriven();\r\n// => 5\r\n```\r\n\r\n## 4. Check for a drained battery\r\n\r\nUpdate the `RemoteControlCar.Drive()` method to drain the battery based on the car's battery drain. Also implement the `RemoteControlCar.BatteryDrained()` method that indicates if the battery is drained:\r\n\r\n```csharp\r\nint speed = 5;\r\nint batteryDrain = 2;\r\nvar car = new RemoteControlCar(speed, batteryDrain);\r\ncar.Drive();\r\n\r\ncar.BatteryDrained();\r\n// => false\r\n```\r\n\r\n## 5. Create the Nitro remote control car\r\n\r\nThe best-selling remote control car is the Nitro, which has a stunning top speed of 50 meters with a battery drain of 4%. Implement the (static) `RemoteControlCar.Nitro()` method to return this type of car:\r\n\r\n```csharp\r\nvar car = RemoteControlCar.Nitro();\r\ncar.Drive();\r\ncar.DistanceDriven();\r\n// => 50\r\n```\r\n## 6. Check if a remote control car can finish a race\r\n\r\nTo finish a race track, a car has to be able to drive the track's distance. This means not draining its battery before having crossed the finish line. Implement the `RaceTrack.TryFinishTrack()` method that takes a `RemoteControlCar` instance as its parameter and returns `true` if the car can finish the race track; otherwise, return `false`:\r\n\r\n```csharp\r\nint speed = 5;\r\nint batteryDrain = 2;\r\nvar car = new RemoteControlCar(speed, batteryDrain);\r\n\r\nint distance = 100;\r\nvar raceTrack = new RaceTrack(distance);\r\n\r\nraceTrack.TryFinishTrack(car);\r\n// => true\r\n```\r\n",
    "hints": "# Hints\r\n\r\n## 1. Creating a remote controlled car\r\n\r\n- [Define a constructor][constructor-syntax] that has two `int` parameters.\r\n- Store the two parameters as [fields][fields] to access them from the classes' methods.\r\n\r\n## 2. Creating a race track\r\n\r\n- [Define a constructor][constructor-syntax] that has one `int` parameter.\r\n- Store the parameter as a [field][fields] to access it from the class' method.\r\n\r\n## 3. Drive the car\r\n\r\n- Add a [field][fields] to keep track of the distance driven.\r\n- Add the car's speed to the [field][fields] that keeps track of the distance driven.\r\n\r\n## 4. Check for a drained battery\r\n\r\n- Add a [field][fields] to keep track of the remaining battery charge percentage (starts at 100%).\r\n- Remove the car's battery drain from the [field][fields] to keep track of the battery charge.\r\n- Don't update the distance driven if the battery is drained.\r\n- Remember that if the battery charge is less than the battery drain percentage, it is considered drained.\r\n\r\n## 5. Create the Nitro remote control car\r\n\r\n- [Instantiate][instance-constructors] an instance of the `RemoteControlCar` with the correct arguments.\r\n\r\n## 6. Check if a remote control car can finish a race\r\n\r\n- Solving this is probably best done by [repeatedly driving the car][while].\r\n- Remember that the car has a method to retrieve the distance it has driven.\r\n- Consider what to do when the battery has been drained before reaching the finish line.\r\n\r\n[constructor-syntax]: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/programming-guide/classes-and-structs/constructors#constructor-syntax\r\n[instance-constructors]: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/programming-guide/classes-and-structs/instance-constructors\r\n[while]: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/keywords/while\r\n[fields]: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/programming-guide/classes-and-structs/fields\r\n"
