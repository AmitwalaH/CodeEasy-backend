    "introduction": "# Introduction\r\n\r\n## Method Overloading\r\n\r\n_Method overloading_ allows multiple methods in the same class to have the same name. Overloaded methods must be different from each other by either:\r\n\r\n- The number of parameters\r\n- The type of the parameters\r\n\r\nThere is no method overloading based on the return type.\r\n\r\nThe compiler will automatically infer which overloaded method to call based on the number of parameters and their type.\r\n\r\n## Named Arguments\r\n\r\nSo far we have seen that the arguments passed into a method are matched to the method's declared parameters based on position. An alternative approach, particularly where a routine takes a large number of arguments, the caller can match arguments by specifying the declared parameter's identifier.\r\n\r\nThe following illustrates the syntax:\r\n\r\n```csharp\r\nclass Card\r\n{\r\n    static string NewYear(int year, int month, int day)\r\n    {\r\n        return $\"Happy {year}-{month}-{day}!\";\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n\r\nCard.NewYear(month: 1, day: 1, year: 2020);  // => \"Happy 2020-1-1!\"\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Optional Parameters\r\n\r\nA method parameter can be made optional by assigning it a default value. When calling a method with optional parameters, the caller is not required to pass a value for them. If no value is passed for an optional parameter, its default value will be used.\r\n\r\nOptional parameters _must_ be at the end of the parameter list; they cannot be followed by non-optional parameters.\r\n\r\n```csharp\r\nclass Card\r\n{\r\n    static string NewYear(int year = 2020)\r\n    {\r\n        return $\"Happy {year}!\";\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n\r\nCard.NewYear();     // => \"Happy 2020!\"\r\nCard.NewYear(1999); // => \"Happy 1999!\"\r\n```\r\n",
    "instructions": "# Instructions\r\n\r\nIn this exercise you're playing a role-playing game named \"Wizard and Warriors\" with your best friends. You are the Game Master, the person tasked with making the game world come alive for the players. A key aspect of this is describing the game to the players: what is a character's status, what the town they're visiting looks like, etc.\r\n\r\nYou have five tasks that have you describe parts of the game to the players.\r\n\r\n## 1. Describe a character\r\n\r\nEach character has a class, level and number of hit points and is described as: `\"You're a level <LEVEL> <CLASS> with <HIT_POINTS> hit points.\"`. Implement the (static) `GameMaster.Describe` method that takes a `Character` as its sole parameter and returns its description.\r\n\r\n```csharp\r\nvar character = new Character();\r\ncharacter.Class = \"Wizard\";\r\ncharacter.Level = 4;\r\ncharacter.HitPoints = 28;\r\n\r\nGameMaster.Describe(character);\r\n// => \"You're a level 4 Wizard with 28 hit points.\"\r\n```\r\n\r\n## 2. Describe a destination\r\n\r\nEach destination has a name and a number of inhabitants and is described as: `\"You've arrived at <NAME>, which has <INHABITANTS> inhabitants.\"`. Implement the (static) `GameMaster.Describe` method that takes a `Destination` as its sole parameter and returns its description.\r\n\r\n```csharp\r\nvar destination = new Destination();\r\ndestination.Name = \"Muros\";\r\ndestination.Inhabitants = 732;\r\n\r\nGameMaster.Describe(destination);\r\n// => \"You've arrived at Muros, which has 732 inhabitants.\"\r\n```\r\n\r\n## 3. Describe the travel method\r\n\r\nCharacters can travel to a destination using one of two options:\r\n\r\n- Walking, described as: `\"You're traveling to your destination by walking.\"`\r\n- On horseback, described as: `\"You're traveling to your destination on horseback.\"`\r\n\r\nImplement the (static) `GameMaster.Describe` method that takes a `TravelMethod` as its sole parameter and returns its description.\r\n\r\n```csharp\r\nGameMaster.Describe(TravelMethod.Horseback);\r\n// => \"You're traveling to your destination on horseback.\"\r\n```\r\n\r\n## 4. Describe a character traveling to a destination\r\n\r\nWhen a character is traveling to a destination, this is described as a combination of the individual descriptions: `\"<CHARACTER> <TRAVEL_METHOD> <DESTINATION>\"`. Implement the (static) `GameMaster.Describe` method that takes a `Character`, a `Destination` and a `TravelMethod` as its parameters and return its description.\r\n\r\n```csharp\r\nvar character = new Character();\r\ncharacter.Class = \"Wizard\";\r\ncharacter.Level = 4;\r\ncharacter.HitPoints = 28;\r\n\r\nvar destination = new Destination();\r\ndestination.Name = \"Muros\";\r\ndestination.Inhabitants = 732;\r\n\r\nGameMaster.Describe(character, destination, TravelMethod.Horseback);\r\n// => \"You're a level 4 Wizard with 28 hit points. You're traveling to your destination on horseback. You've arrived at Muros, which has 732 inhabitants.\"\r\n```\r\n\r\n## 5. Describe a character traveling to a destination without specifying the travel method\r\n\r\nIn the majority of cases, characters are traveling to a destination by walking. For convenience, players are allowed to omit mentioning their travel method, in which case walking will be assumed to be the travel method. Implement the (static) `GameMaster.Describe` method that takes a `Character` and a `Destination` as its parameters and return its description.\r\n\r\n```csharp\r\nvar character = new Character();\r\ncharacter.Class = \"Wizard\";\r\ncharacter.Level = 4;\r\ncharacter.HitPoints = 28;\r\n\r\nvar destination = new Destination();\r\ndestination.Name = \"Muros\";\r\ndestination.Inhabitants = 732;\r\n\r\nGameMaster.Describe(character, destination);\r\n// => \"You're a level 4 Wizard with 28 hit points. You're traveling to your destination by walking. You've arrived at Muros, which has 732 inhabitants.\"\r\n```\r\n",
    "hints": "# Hints\r\n\r\n## General\r\n\r\n- [Method overloading in C#][member-overloading].\r\n- [String interpolation][string-interpolation] can be used to format description strings.\r\n\r\n## 3. Describe the travel method\r\n\r\n- A [simple conditional][if-statement] can be used for the conditional logic.\r\n\r\n## 4. Describe a character traveling to a destination\r\n\r\n- You can re-use the existing describe functionality.\r\n- You can use [expressions in interpolated strings][string-interpolation-expressions], which means you can call methods directly in the interpolated parts of an interpolated string.\r\n\r\n## 5. Describe a character traveling to a destination without specifying the travel method\r\n\r\n- You can re-use the existing functionality that does take an explicit travel method.\r\n- You can use [optional parameters][optional-arguments] to simplify the amount of code you need.\r\n\r\n[member-overloading]: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/design-guidelines/member-overloading\r\n[optional-arguments]: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/programming-guide/classes-and-structs/named-and-optional-arguments#optional-arguments\r\n[string-interpolation]: https://csharp.net-tutorials.com/operators/the-string-interpolation-operator/\r\n[string-interpolation-expressions]: https://csharp.net-tutorials.com/operators/the-string-interpolation-operator/#aelm5419\r\n[if-statement]: https://csharp.net-tutorials.com/control-structures/if-statement/\r\n"
