    "about": "# About\r\n\r\nTo repeatedly execute logic, one can use loops. One of the most common loop types in C# is the `while` loop, which keeps on looping until a Boolean condition evaluates to `false`.\r\n\r\n```csharp\r\nint x = 23;\r\n\r\nwhile (x > 10)\r\n{\r\n    // Execute logic if x > 10\r\n    x = x - 1;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n",
    "introduction": "# Introduction\r\n\r\nIn this exercise you may also want to use a loop. There are several ways to write loops in C#, but the `while` loop is most appropriate here:\r\n\r\n```csharp\r\nint x = 23;\r\n\r\nwhile (x > 10)\r\n{\r\n    // Execute logic if x > 10\r\n    x = x - 2;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n"
