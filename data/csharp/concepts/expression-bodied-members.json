Defining a member with an expression often produces more concise and readable code than traditional blocks/statements.\r\n\r\n```csharp\r\npublic int Times3(int input) => input * 3;\r\n\r\npublic int Interesting => 1729;\r\n```\r\n\r\nExpression-bodied-members cannot have blocks of multiple statements, but those with a functional background should be warned that anything that a traditional member can do can be achieved by one of these members. The \"expression\" can be an assignment operation creating side effects, or a method invocation meaning that anything is possible.\r\n\r\n[expression-bodied-members]: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/programming-guide/statements-expressions-operators/expression-bodied-members\r\n",
