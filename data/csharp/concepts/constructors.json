A constructor is a special type of method whose goal is to initialize a newly created instance. [Constructors look like regular methods][constructor-syntax], but without a return type and with a name that matches the classes' name.\r\n\r\n```csharp\r\nclass Library\r\n{\r\n    private books;\r\n\r\n    public Library()\r\n    {\r\n        this.books = 10;\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n\r\n// This will call the constructor\r\nvar library = new Library();\r\n```\r\n\r\nLike regular methods, constructors can have parameters. Constructor parameters are usually stored as (private) [fields][fields] to be accessed later, or else used in some one-off calculation. Arguments can be passed to constructors just like passing arguments to regular methods.\r\n\r\n```csharp\r\nclass Building\r\n{\r\n    private int numberOfStories;\r\n    private int totalHeight;\r\n\r\n    public Building(int numberOfStories, double storyHeight)\r\n    {\r\n        this.numberOfStories = numberOfStories;\r\n        this.totalHeight = numberOfStories * storyHeight;\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n\r\n// Call a constructor with two arguments\r\nvar largeBuilding = new Building(55, 6.2);\r\n```\r\n\r\nSpecifying a constructor is optional. If no constructor is specified, a [parameterless constructor][parameterless-constructors] is generated by the compiler:\r\n\r\n```csharp\r\nclass Elevator\r\n{\r\n}\r\n\r\n// This will call the (empty) generated constructor\r\nvar elevator = new Elevator();\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf fields have an initial value assigned to them, the compiler will output code in which the assignment is actually done inside the constructor. The following class declarations are thus equivalent (functionality-wise):\r\n\r\n```csharp\r\nclass UsingFieldInitialization\r\n{\r\n    private int players = 5;\r\n}\r\n\r\nclass UsingConstructorInitialization\r\n{\r\n    private int players;\r\n\r\n    public UsingConstructorInitialization()\r\n    {\r\n        players = 5;\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n[constructors]: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/programming-guide/classes-and-structs/constructors\r\n[constructor-syntax]: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/programming-guide/classes-and-structs/constructors#constructor-syntax\r\n[using-constructors]: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/programming-guide/classes-and-structs/using-constructors\r\n[private-constructors]: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/programming-guide/classes-and-structs/private-constructors\r\n[new]: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/operators/new-operator\r\n[fields]: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/programming-guide/classes-and-structs/fields\r\n[parameterless-constructors]: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/programming-guide/classes-and-structs/constructors#parameterless-constructors\r\n",
