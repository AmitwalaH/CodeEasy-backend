    "about": "# About\r\n\r\nThere are three floating-point types in C#: `double`, `float` and `decimal`. The most commonly used type is `double`, whereas `decimal` is normally used when working with monetary data. A `double` is written as `2.45` or `2.45d`, a `float` as `2.45f` and a decimal as `2.45m`.\r\n\r\nEach floating-point type has its own [precision, approximate range and size][docs-microsoft.com-characteristics-of-the-floating-point-types].\r\n\r\nSome conversions between floating point types are [automatic (implicit)][docs-microsoft.com-implicit-numeric-conversion], but others are [manual (explicit)][docs-microsoft.com-explicit-numeric-conversion].\r\n\r\n```csharp\r\ndecimal account = 125m * (decimal)1.2f;\r\n```\r\n\r\nAlways be careful when checking the values of floating-point types for equality, as values that can appear to represent the same value could actually be different. See [this article][docs.microsoft.com_precision-in-comparisons] for more information.\r\n\r\nYou can find a short introduction to floating-point numbers at [0.30000000000000004.com][0.30000000000000004.com]. The [Float Toy page][evanw.github.io-float-toy] has a nice, graphical explanation how a floating-point numbers' bits are converted to an actual floating-point value.\r\n\r\n[docs-microsoft.com-explicit-numeric-conversion]: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/builtin-types/numeric-conversions#explicit-numeric-conversions\r\n[docs-microsoft.com-implicit-numeric-conversion]: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/builtin-types/numeric-conversions#implicit-numeric-conversions\r\n[docs-microsoft.com-characteristics-of-the-floating-point-types]: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/builtin-types/floating-point-numeric-types#characteristics-of-the-floating-point-types\r\n[docs.microsoft.com_precision-in-comparisons]: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.double.equals#precision-in-comparisons\r\n[0.30000000000000004.com]: https://0.30000000000000004.com/\r\n[evanw.github.io-float-toy]: https://evanw.github.io/float-toy/\r\n",
    "introduction": "# Introduction\r\n\r\nA floating-point number is a number with zero or more digits behind the decimal separator. Examples are `-2.4`, `0.1`, `3.14`, `16.984025` and `1024.0`.\r\n\r\nDifferent floating-point types can store different numbers of digits after the digit separator - this is referred to as its precision.\r\n\r\nC# has three floating-point types:\r\n\r\n- `float`: 4 bytes (~6-9 digits precision). Written as `2.45f`.\r\n- `double`: 8 bytes (~15-17 digits precision). This is the most common type. Written as `2.45` or `2.45d`.\r\n- `decimal`: 16 bytes (28-29 digits precision). Normally used when working with monetary data, as its precision leads to less rounding errors. Written as `2.45m`.\r\n\r\nAs can be seen, each type can store a different number of digits. This means that trying to store PI in a `float` will only store the first 6 to 9 digits (with the last digit being rounded).\r\n"
