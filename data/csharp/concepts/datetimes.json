    "about": "# About\r\n\r\nA `DateTime` in C# is an immutable object that contains both date _and_ time information. The date and time information can be accessed through its built-in [properties][properties].\r\n\r\nManipulating a `DateTime` can be done by calling one of its [methods][methods]. As `DateTime` values can never change after having been defined, all methods that appear to modify a `DateTime` will actually return a new `DateTime`.\r\n\r\nComparing `DateTime` instances can be done using the default comparison operators (`<`, `>`, etc.). The current date (and time) can be retrieved through the `DateTime.Now` property.\r\n\r\nAn important aspect of dates in C# is that they are culture-dependent. As such, any `DateTime` method that deals with `string`s will be dependent on the current culture. This includes the [`DateTime.Parse()` method][parse] that parses a `string` to a `DateTime`, as well as the `DateTime` class' [`ToString()` method][to-string] that converts a `DateTime` to a `string`.\r\n\r\n[parse]: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.datetime.parse\r\n[operators]: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.datetime\r\n[properties]: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.datetime\r\n[to-string]: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.datetime.tostring\r\n[methods]: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.datetime\r\n",
    "introduction": "# Introduction\r\n\r\nA `DateTime` in C# is an immutable object that contains both date _and_ time information. `DateTime` instances are manipulated by calling their methods. Once a `DateTime` has been constructed, its value can never change. Any methods that appear to modify a `DateTime` will actually return a new `DateTime`.\r\n\r\nThe textual representation of dates and times is dependent on the _culture_. Consider a `DateTime` with its date set to March 28 2019 and its time set to 14:30:59. Converting this `DateTime` to a `string` when using the `en-US` culture (American English) returns `\"3/28/19 2:30:59 PM\"`. When using the `fr-BE` culture (Belgian French), the same code returns a different value: `\"28/03/19 14:30:59\"`.\r\n\r\nUnderstanding which `DateTime` methods are culture-dependent is important to know. In general, any `DateTime` method that deals with `string`s (either as input or output) will be dependent on the current culture.\r\n"
