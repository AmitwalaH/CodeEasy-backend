    "about": "# About\r\n\r\nUsing `StringBuilder` is seen as hugely preferable to building up strings with multiple repeated concatenations with\r\na `+` or `+=` operator. Obviously simple one off concatenations are preferable\r\nto instantiating a `StringBuilder` for clarity as well as performance. [This][skeet-stringbuilder] is what [Jon Skeet][so-jon-skeet] has to say about performance.\r\n\r\n[skeet-stringbuilder]: https://jonskeet.uk/csharp/stringbuilder.html\r\n[so-jon-skeet]: https://stackoverflow.com/users/22656/jon-skeet\r\n",
    "introduction": "# Introduction\r\n\r\n`char`s are sometimes used in conjunction with a `StringBuilder` object.\r\nThis object has methods that allow a string to be constructed\r\ncharacter by character and manipulated. At the end of the process\r\n`ToString` can be called on it to output a complete string.\r\n"
