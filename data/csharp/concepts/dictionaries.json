    "about": "# About\r\n\r\nDictionaries, like their equivalents in other languages such as maps or associative arrays, store key/value pairs such that a value can be retrieved or changed directly by passing the key to the dictionary's indexer property.\r\n\r\nIn addition key/value pairs can be added and removed from the dictionary. Keys, values and key/value pairs can be enumerated.\r\n\r\nValues can be objects of any C# type, which includes primitives, structs _and_ classes.\r\n\r\nThe Dictionary object allows keys to be objects of any type. However to ensure correct behavior at runtime keys must have an appropriate hashcode as returned by [GetHashCode][gethashcode].\r\n\r\nA dictionary instance cannot be safely accessed by more than one thread (not thread-safe). [ConcurrentDictionary][concurrent-dictionary] is available for multi-threading situations.\r\n\r\nSee also [HashSet][hashset], [ConcurrentDictionary][concurrent-dictionary], [SortedDictionary][sorted-dictionary].\r\n\r\nWhilst there is no non-generic version of Dictionary a number of classes remain in the library to support a non-generic map. You need to be aware of the non-generic IDictionary and Hashtable mainly so that you know them when you see them. It is unlikely you would have to use them other than in maintaining an old code base.\r\n\r\nYou will often want to expose and access the dictionary by its [`IDictionary<TKey, TValue>`][idictionary] interface.\r\n\r\nNote that because of the nature of [indexer properties][indexer-properties] primitive values can be modified in place, such as:\r\n\r\n```csharp\r\nnums[\"some-number\"] = 3;\r\nnums[\"some-number\"]++;\r\n// nums[\"some-number\"] == 4\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n[concurrent-dictionary]: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-gb/dotnet/api/system.collections.concurrent.concurrentdictionary-2\r\n[hashset]: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-gb/dotnet/api/system.collections.generic.hashset-1\r\n[gethashcode]: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.object.gethashcode\r\n[sorted-dictionary]: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.collections.generic.sorteddictionary-2\r\n[idictionary]: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.collections.generic.idictionary-2\r\n[indexer-properties]: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/programming-guide/indexers/\r\n",
    "introduction": "# Introduction\r\n\r\nA dictionary is a collection of elements where each element comprises a key and value such that if a key is passed to a method of the dictionary its associated value is returned. It has the same role as maps or associative arrays do in other languages.\r\n\r\nA dictionary can be created as follows:\r\n\r\n```csharp\r\nnew Dictionary<int, string>();\r\n// Empty dictionary\r\n```\r\n\r\nOr\r\n\r\n```csharp\r\nnew Dictionary<int, string>\r\n{\r\n    [1] = \"One\",\r\n    [2] = \"Two\"\r\n};\r\n\r\n// Or\r\n\r\nnew Dictionary<int, string>\r\n{\r\n    {1, \"One\"},\r\n    {2, \"Two\"}\r\n};\r\n// 1 => \"One\", 2 => \"Two\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nNote that the key and value types are part of the definition of the dictionary.\r\n\r\nOnce constructed, entries can be added or removed from a dictionary using its built-in methods `Add` and `Remove`.\r\n\r\nRetrieving or updating values in a dictionary is done by indexing into the dictionary using a key:\r\n\r\n```csharp\r\nvar numbers = new Dictionary<int, string>\r\n{\r\n   {1, \"One\"},\r\n   {2, \"Two\"}\r\n};\r\n\r\n// Set the value of the element with key 2 to \"Deux\"\r\nnumbers[2] = \"Deux\";\r\n\r\n// Get the value of the element with key 2\r\nnumbers[2];\r\n// => \"Deux\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou can test if a value exists in the dictionary with:\r\n\r\n```csharp\r\nvar dict = new Dictionary<string, string>{/*...*/};\r\ndict.ContainsKey(\"some key that exists\");\r\n// => true\r\n```\r\n\r\nEnumerating over a dictionary will enumerate over its key/value pairs. Dictionaries also have properties that allow enumerating over its keys or values.\r\n\r\n[indexer-properties]: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/programming-guide/indexers/\r\n"
