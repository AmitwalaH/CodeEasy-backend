    "about": "# About\r\n\r\nA user-defined exception is any class defined in your code that is derived from `System.Exception`. It is subject to all the rules of class inheritance but in addition the compiler and language runtime treat such classes in a special way allowing their instances to be thrown and caught outside the normal control flow as discussed in the `exceptions` exercise. User-defined exceptions can be used in every way like runtime and Microsoft Base Class Library exceptions.\r\n\r\nThis special treatment applies only to `Exception`-derived classes. You cannot throw instances of any other type.\r\n\r\nUser-defined exceptions are often used to carry extra information such as a message and other relevant data to be made available to the catching routines. This can then be recorded in logs, reported to a user or perhaps used in a retry operation. `System.Exception` has convenient data members and appropriate constructors to hold a message and the \"inner\" exception.\r\n\r\nBy convention exception class names end with \"Exception\", e.g. `MyTerribleException`.\r\n\r\nWhilst using user-defined exceptions to wrap and enhance third party exceptions is a frequently seen pattern, the general advice is not to use them outside of this use case too liberally in your own code. It is considered an anti-pattern. There are challenges to this view and you can see both sides of the argument in this [Stack Exchange post][se-exceptions].\r\n\r\nThis [article][create-user-defined-exceptions] is a good introduction to user-defined exceptions.\r\n\r\nAs part of their guidance on [creating and throwing exceptions][exceptions-guidance] the .NET team recommend that user defined exceptions have a number of [convenience constructors][convenience-constructors]. For most purposes the combination illustrated below is appropriate.\r\n\r\n```csharp\r\npublic class IncompleteExerciseException : System.Exception\r\n{\r\n    public IncompleteExerciseException() : base() { }\r\n    public IncompleteExerciseException(string message) : base(message) { }\r\n    public IncompleteExerciseException(string message, System.Exception inner) : base(message, inner) { }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n[create-user-defined-exceptions]: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/exceptions/how-to-create-user-defined-exceptions\r\n[se-exceptions]: https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/189222/are-exceptions-as-control-flow-considered-a-serious-antipattern-if-so-why\r\n[exceptions-guidance]: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/programming-guide/exceptions/creating-and-throwing-exceptions\r\n[convenience-constructors]: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/programming-guide/exceptions/creating-and-throwing-exceptions#defining-exception-classes\r\n",
