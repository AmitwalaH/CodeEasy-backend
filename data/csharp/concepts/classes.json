The fields and methods of a class are known as its _members_.\r\n\r\nAccess to members can be restricted through access modifiers, the two most common ones being:\r\n\r\n- [`public`][public]: the member can be accessed by any code (no restrictions).\r\n- [`private`][private]: the member can only be accessed by code in the same class.\r\n\r\nIt is customary to specify an access modifier for all members. If no access modifier is specified, it will default to `private`.\r\n\r\nThe above-mentioned grouping of related data and behavior plus restricting access to members is known as [encapsulation][encapsulation], which is one of the core object-oriented concepts.\r\n\r\nThe combination of field values of an object at any one time are known as the object's [state][object-state].\r\n\r\nYou can think of a class as a template for creating instances of that class. To [create an instance of a class][creating-objects] (also known as an _object_), the [`new` keyword][new] is used:\r\n\r\n```csharp\r\nclass Car\r\n{\r\n}\r\n\r\n// Create two car instances\r\nvar myCar = new Car();\r\nvar yourCar = new Car();\r\n```\r\n\r\n[Fields][fields] have a type and can be defined anywhere in a class.\r\nPublic fields are defined in [PascalCase][pascal-case] and private fields are defined in [camelCase][camel-case] and prefixed with an underscore `_`:\r\n\r\n```csharp\r\nclass Car\r\n{\r\n    // Accessible by anyone\r\n    public int Weight;\r\n\r\n    // Only accessible by code in this class\r\n    private string _color;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nOne can optionally assign an initial value to a field. If a field does _not_ specify an initial value, it will be set to its type's [default value][default-values]. An instance's field values can be accessed and updated using dot-notation.\r\n\r\n```csharp\r\nclass Car\r\n{\r\n    // Will be set to specified value\r\n    public int Weight = 2500;\r\n\r\n    // Will be set to default value (0)\r\n    public int Year;\r\n}\r\n\r\nvar newCar = new Car();\r\nnewCar.Weight; // => 2500\r\nnewCar.Year;   // => 0\r\n\r\n// Update value of the field\r\nnewCar.Year = 2018;\r\n```\r\n\r\nPrivate fields are usually updated as a side-effect of calling a method. Such methods usually don't return any value, in which case the return type should be [`void`][void]:\r\n\r\n```csharp\r\nclass CarImporter\r\n{\r\n    private int _carsImported;\r\n\r\n    public void ImportCars(int numberOfCars)\r\n    {\r\n        // Update private field\r\n        _carsImported = _carsImported + numberOfCars;\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nNote that is not customary to use public fields in C# classes. Either private fields are used or other types of members that will be discussed in subsequent exercises.\r\n\r\nWithin a class, the [`this` keyword][this] will refer to the current class. This is especially useful if a parameter has the same name as a field:\r\n\r\n```csharp\r\nclass CarImporter\r\n{\r\n    private int carsImported;\r\n\r\n    public void SetImportedCars(int carsImported)\r\n    {\r\n        // Update private field from public method\r\n        this.carsImported = carsImported;\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe class and method structure provides a natural way to limit visibility of program elements such as fields and methods and avoid the well-known [problem of global state][so-global-state-problem]. Public fields, methods and other members have to be qualified with the object name, `object.field` or `object.method()`, (class name in the case of statics) to be seen by code outside the class. Variables and parameters declared within a method can be seen only within that method.\r\n\r\nOne thing to be wary of with this approach is that if a field name and the name of a variable or parameter in a method are the same then the field name will be ignored by code within the method which may not be what you desire. In general, you should avoid this where possible although it is a common pattern in constructors. If it is appropriate for the field and variable name to be the same then qualify the field name with the `this` keyword within the method.\r\n\r\nThese [access modifiers][access-modifiers] can be used to further limit visibility.\r\n\r\n[fields]: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/programming-guide/classes-and-structs/fields\r\n[methods]: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/programming-guide/classes-and-structs/methods\r\n[this]: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/keywords/this\r\n[new]: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/operators/new-operator\r\n[void]: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/builtin-types/void\r\n[creating-objects]: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/programming-guide/classes-and-structs/classes#creating-objects\r\n[fields]: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/programming-guide/classes-and-structs/fields\r\n[public]: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/keywords/public\r\n[private]: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/keywords/private\r\n[default-values]: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/builtin-types/default-values\r\n[camel-case]: https://techterms.com/definition/camelcase\r\n[pascal-case]: https://techterms.com/definition/pascalcase\r\n[encapsulation]: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/architecture/modern-web-apps-azure/architectural-principles#encapsulation\r\n[visibility]: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/c-language/scope-and-visibility\r\n[object-state]: https://cs.stackexchange.com/questions/6536/definition-of-the-state-of-an-object-in-oop\r\n[so-global-state-problem]: https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/148108/why-is-global-state-so-evil\r\n[access-modifiers]: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/programming-guide/classes-and-structs/access-modifiers\r\n",
