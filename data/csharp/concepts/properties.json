    "about": "# About\r\n\r\nThe two main types of property are\r\n\r\n1. auto-implemented properties where the `get` and `set` accessors have no body.\r\n   They may or may not be explicitly initialized. For example:\r\n   ```csharp\r\n   public int MyProperty {get; set;} = 42;\r\n   ```\r\n2. those where the accessors evaluate expressions and execute statements. The code can\r\n   be as simple as returning or assigning a backing field. For example:\r\n   ```csharp\r\n   private int myField;\r\n   public int MyProperty\r\n   {\r\n     get { return myField; }\r\n     set { myField = value; }\r\n   }\r\n   ```\r\n\r\nThere is considerable overlap of behavior and power between properties and methods.\r\nWhen they are not auto-implemented properties can contain any statement or expression\r\nthat can appear within the scope of the class. In a common case they are often described\r\nas wrapping a backing field.\r\nAlthough much of the time it is obvious whether to code behavior as a property or method in a particular case it is\r\noften a judgement call for the coder and in particular how much code should be\r\nexecuted within the accessors. Validation in a set accessor and simple calculation or formatting in a\r\nget accessor are commonly found:\r\n\r\n```csharp\r\nprivate float fraction;\r\npublic float Percentage\r\n{\r\n  get { return fraction * 100; }\r\n  set\r\n  {\r\n    if (value < 0 || value > 100)\r\n    {\r\n      throw new ArgumentException(\"Percentage must be between 0 and 100\");\r\n    }\r\n    fraction = value / 100;\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn a similar way to other class members properties can have access levels.\r\nMost often properties will have a non-private access level in line with\r\ntheir essential purpose. Sometimes one of the accessors will have\r\na different access level to the property. In the case of `TareWeight`\r\nunder the rather artificial \"security\" constraint there was an opportunity\r\nto have a public property with a private getter. This means that code external\r\nto the class can set the value of the property but it can only be read (get) by code within\r\nthe class.\r\n\r\n```csharp\r\npublic int ConfidentialValueUsedInternally {private get; set; }\r\n```\r\n\r\nNon-public set accessors are also supported but a more common case is where\r\nthe set accessor may be omitted completely. This is maybe because\r\nthe value of the property is set in the class's constructor.\r\n\r\n```csharp\r\nclass MyClass\r\n{\r\n  public MyClass( int importantValue)\r\n  {\r\n    ConstructedValue = importantValue;\r\n  }\r\n  public int ConstructedValue {get;}\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis exercise has dealt with basic use of properties. You will find more advanced\r\ntopics in other exercises:\r\n\r\n- expression bodied properties, get accessors and set accessors (covered by expression-bodied members)\r\n- properties on interfaces (covered by Interfaces)\r\n- properties/abstract properties on abstract classes (covered by Inheritance)\r\n- use of the `readonly` keyword with properties (covered by Immutability)\r\n- static properties (covered by Statics)\r\n- indexers (covered by Indexers)\r\n",
    "introduction": "# Introduction\r\n\r\nA property in C# is a member of a class that provides access to data within that class.\r\nCallers can set or retrieve (get) the data. Properties can be either auto-implemented or\r\nhave a backing field. They comprise a set accessor and/or a get accessor.\r\nIn some other languages a \"mutator\" is roughly equivalent to\r\na set accessor and an \"accessor\" is roughly equivalent to a get accessor although\r\nthe composition of the syntax is completely different.\r\n\r\nWhen setting a property the input value can be validated, formatted\r\nor otherwise manipulated and in fact any programmatic operation accessible to code in the\r\nclass can be executed.\r\n\r\nSimilarly when retrieving a property data can be calculated or formatted and again\r\nany programmatic operation available to the class can be executed.\r\n\r\nProperties have access modifiers (`public`, `private` etc.) in the same way as other\r\nclass members but the set accessor may have an access level independent of the retrieve (get)\r\naccessor and vice versa. A property doesn't have to have both accessors, it can have just one (either get or set).\r\n\r\nThe basic syntax to express properties can take two forms:\r\n\r\n## Field/Expression Backed Properties:\r\n\r\n```csharp\r\nprivate int myField;\r\npublic int MyProperty\r\n{\r\n    get { return myField; }\r\n    set { myField = value; }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Auto-implemented Properties\r\n\r\n```\r\npublic int MyProperty { get; private set; } = 42;\r\n```\r\n\r\nInitialization is optional.\r\n"
