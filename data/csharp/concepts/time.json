    "about": "# About\r\n\r\nAlthough this exercise investigates the concept of `time` in practice you rarely deal with times on their own. They are almost always dealt with in conjunction with dates. There is no specific separate _time_ type, only [`DateTime`][date-time].\r\n\r\nTime-of-day can be expressed with [`TimeSpan`][time-span] (and this is in fact the return type of `DateTime.TimeOfDay`). It is not [purpose made][skeet-time-of-day] so the expressiveness of code can get a bit clunky. For instance, what do you expect time-of-day to be for an instance of `DateTime` that is in UTC form? But, it does the job.\r\n\r\nA discussion of _time_ has a number of facets:\r\n\r\n- local time vs. universal co-ordinated time (UTC)\r\n- arithmetic on `DateTime`\r\n- Time zones (including daylight saving time)\r\n- Date-time string parsing and formatting.\r\n- Resolution (timer selection etc.)\r\n\r\nThis exercise covered local vs. UTC, date-time arithmetic, time-zones and date-time parsing.\r\n\r\n[Formatting][date-string-formatting] is discussed in the `string-formatting` exercise.\r\n\r\nResolution and timers are [much discussed][so-timers] on the web. The `DateTime` API has specific routines to handle file timestamps.\r\n\r\nIt's usually a good idea to store date-times long term in UTC form. This ensures consistency if more than one timezone is in play and this approach avoids potential problems with daylight saving.\r\n\r\nThe disadvantage of UTC times is that they need to be converted to local times if time-of-day is a significant factor.\r\n\r\nFor the most part `DateTime.ToUniversalTime()` and `DateTime.ToLocalTime()` work well as long as processing is based around the timezone of your computer. If multiple time zones are involved, or a different one to that of your computer then you will need the [`TimeZoneInfo`][time-zone-info] class to handle conversions. Not the obsolete ~~TimeZone~~ object.\r\n\r\nYou will recall from the coding exercise that the all-important time zone identifiers differ between Windows and other platforms. This [article][cross-platform-time-zones] is a good introduction to this cross-platform issue. Note that `TimeZoneInfo.GetSystemTimeZones()` will list your platform's time zones.\r\n\r\nThis [article][time-overview] is a good overview of time and timezones.\r\n\r\nFor date time arithmetic, in the coding exercise, you may well have used the `TimeSpan` struct. When you need to do arithmetic involving whole months or years then the `DateTime` struct provides a number of methods such as `AddHours()` and `AddMonths()`.\r\n\r\nIf dates and times are a pervasive and/or critical part of your project then you should investigate [Noda Time][noda-time]\r\n\r\nIn case you were wondering, according to this [Wikipedia article][wiki-utc] the abbreviation for universal time, UTC, arose from a compromise between English (UCT) and French (CUT) speakers such that neither language would appear to take precedence.\r\n\r\n[so-timers]: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/10317088/why-there-are-5-versions-of-timer-classes-in-net\r\n[skeet-time-of-day]: https://stackoverflow.com/a/2037375/96167\r\n[time-overview]: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/datetime/\r\n[date-time]: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.datetime\r\n[noda-time]: https://nodatime.org/\r\n[date-string-formatting]: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/base-types/standard-date-and-time-format-strings\r\n[time-span]: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.timespan\r\n[wiki-utc]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coordinated_Universal_Time\r\n[time-zone-info]: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.timezoneinfo\r\n[cross-platform-time-zones]: https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/cross-platform-time-zones-with-net-core/\r\n",
