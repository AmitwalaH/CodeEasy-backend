    "about": "# About\r\n\r\nTo repeatedly execute logic, one can use loops. If the code in a loop should always be executed at least once, a `do`/`while` loop can be used:\r\n\r\n```csharp\r\nint x = 0;\r\n\r\ndo\r\n{\r\n    x = GetX();\r\n    // do something with x\r\n}\r\nwhile (x != 0);\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis is used less frequently than a `while` loop but in some cases results in more natural looking code.\r\n",
