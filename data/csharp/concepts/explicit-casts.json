    "about": "# About\r\n\r\nWhere types cannot be cast implicitly, you must use an explicit cast [operator][cast-operator].\r\nThe cast operator is nothing more than the target type in parentheses before the value you want to cast:\r\n\r\n```csharp\r\n\r\nint i = 7;\r\nbyte b = (byte)i; // Explicit cast from int to byte\r\n```\r\n\r\nUsing an explicit cast is potentially dangerous. The two most common errors are:\r\n\r\n- Casting to an incompatible type. This will throw an exception at runtime.\r\n- Casting to a numeric value that is insufficiently \"wide\". This can result in a sign conflict or an overflow exception being thrown in the case of integers\r\n\r\nNote: an expression of type `int` can be explicitly cast to `char`. This may result in an invalid `char`.\r\n\r\n[cast-operator]: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/operators/type-testing-and-cast#cast-expression\r\n",
