This echoes functional programming approaches and can often make code more expressive and less error-prone.\r\n\r\nThe ternary operator combines 3 expressions: a condition followed by an expression to be evaluated and returned if the condition is true (the `if` part, introduced by `?`) and an expression to be evaluated and returned if the condition is false (the `else` part, introduced by `:`).\r\n\r\n```csharp\r\nint a = 3, b = 4;\r\nint max = a > b ? a : b;\r\n// => 4\r\n```\r\n\r\n[ternary-operators]: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/operators/conditional-operator\r\n",
