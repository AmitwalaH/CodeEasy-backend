You will also see `HashSet<T>` and `Dictionary<T>` in early exercises.\r\n\r\nIf you need a list of different types then you can use `List<Object>` but you will need to [down cast][casting] elements that you access in from the list.\r\n\r\nYou should also be aware of `System.Collections.List` which you may encounter in legacy code. To all intents and purposes this behaves like `List<Object>`.\r\n\r\n[generics]: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/programming-guide/generics/\r\n[casting]: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/programming-guide/types/casting-and-type-conversions\r\n",
    "introduction": "# Introduction\r\n\r\nA collection definition typically includes a place holder in angle brackets, often `T` by convention. Such a collection is referred to as a generic type. This allows the collection user to specify what type of items to store in the collection. In the above example code we are instantiating a list of strings.\r\n"
