    "about": "# About\r\n\r\nLists in C# are collections of primitive values or instances of structs or classes. They are implemented in the base class library as [`List<T>`][lists-docs] where `T` is the type of the item in the list. The API exposes a rich set of methods for creating and manipulating lists.\r\n\r\n```csharp\r\nvar listOfStrings = new List<string>();\r\nvar listOfIntegers = new List<int>();\r\nvar listOfRandoms = new List<Random>();\r\nvar listOfBigIntegers = new List<BigInteger>();\r\n```\r\n\r\nA collection definition typically includes a place holder in angle brackets, often `T` by convention. This allows the collection user to specify what type of items to store in the collection.\r\n\r\nUnlike [concept:csharp/arrays](), lists can resize themselves dynamically.\r\n\r\n## LINQ\r\n\r\nAlthough the built-in API of `List<T>` is rich (including mappings and filters such as `ConvertAll`, `FindAll` and `Foreach`) and its [looping syntax][for-each] is very clear, and you definitely need to be familiar with this API, Language Integrated Query ([LINQ][linq]) is available for many tasks, is even more powerful and widely used and has the advantage of providing a consistent interface across library collections, third-party collections and your own classes.\r\n\r\n[lists-docs]: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.collections.generic.list-1\r\n[lists-tutorial]: https://csharp.net-tutorials.com/collections/lists/\r\n[linq]: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/programming-guide/concepts/linq/\r\n[for-each]: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/keywords/foreach-in\r\n",
