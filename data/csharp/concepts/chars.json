    "about": "# About\r\n\r\n`char`s are generally easy to use. They can be extracted from strings, added back\r\n(by means of a string builder), defined and initialised using literals with single quotes, as in `char ch = 'A';`\r\n, assigned and compared.\r\n\r\nGeneral information on `char`s can be found here:\r\n\r\n- [Chars documentation][chars-docs]: reference documentation for `char`.\r\n- [Chars tutorial][chars-tutorial]: basic tutorial on how to work with chars.\r\n\r\nHowever, `char`s have a number of rough edges as detailed below.\r\nThese rough edges mostly relate to the opposition\r\nbetween the full unicode standard on the one side and historic representations\r\nof text as well as performance and memory usage on the other.\r\n\r\n## Unicode Issues\r\n\r\nWhen dealing with strings, if `System.String` library methods are available you should\r\nseek these out and use them rather than breaking the string down into characters.\r\nSome textual \"characters\" consist of more than one `char` because the unicode standard\r\nhas more than 65536 code points. For instance the emojis that show up in some\r\nof the tests have 2 `char`s as they comprise [surrogate][surrogates] characters.\r\nAdditionally, there are combining sequences for instance where in some cases\r\nan accented character may consist of one `char` for the plain character\r\nand another `char` for the accent.\r\n\r\nIf you have to deal with individual characters you should try to use\r\nlibrary methods such as [`System.Char.IsControl`][is-control], [`System.Char.IsDigit`][is-digit]\r\nrather than making naive comparisons such as checking that a character is\r\nbetween '0' and '9'. For instance, note that '٢' is the arabic digit 2. `IsDigit`\r\nwill return true for the arabic version so you need to be clear say when validating\r\nwhat range of inputs is acceptable. Even the `System.Char` library methods may not\r\nbehave as you would expect when you are dealing with more obscure languages.\r\n\r\nOne way safely to break a string into display \"characters\" is to use [`StringInfo`][string-info] and\r\nmethods such as [`GetNexttextElement`][get-next-text-element]. This might be necessary if you are\r\ndealing with globalization/localization. Another avenue where the scalar values\r\nof unicode characters is important (say you are rolling your own encoding system) is to use\r\n[runes][runes]. However, if you know the range of characters\r\nyou deal with does not include surrogates or combining character sequences (e.g. Latin ASCII) and your input\r\nis well validated then you can avoid this. Again, the best position to be in\r\nis where you can use `String`'s library methods.\r\n\r\nIf you do find yourself in the unenviable position of dealing with the minutiae of unicode\r\nthen [this][char-encoding-net] is a good starting point.\r\n\r\n## Globalization\r\n\r\nIf you are working in an environment where you are dealing with multiple cultures or\r\nthe culture is important in some parts of the code but not others then be\r\naware of the overloads of [`ToUpper`][to-upper] and [`ToLower`][to-lower] which take a culture and\r\n[`ToUpperInvariant`][to-upper-invariant] and [`ToLowerInvariant`][to-lower-invariant] which will provide a consistent\r\nresult irrespective of the current [culture][culture-info].\r\n\r\n## Representation, Characters and Integers\r\n\r\nLike other simple types (`int`s, `bool`s, etc.) the `char` has a companion\r\nor alias type, in this case, `System.Char`. This is in fact a `struct` with\r\na 16 bit field. `char` in fact has some instance methods such as\r\n`Equals`, `ToString` and [`CompareTo`][compare-to].\r\n\r\n`char` has the same width as a [`ushort`][uint16] but they are generally\r\nnot used inter-changeably as they are in some languages. `ushort` has\r\nto be explicitly cast to a `char`. For what it's worth `char`s can\r\nbe subject to arithmetic operations. The result of these operations is an integer.\r\n\r\nObviously there is no equivalence between a `byte` at 8 bits and the 16 bit `char`.\r\n\r\n[chars-docs]: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/builtin-types/char\r\n[chars-tutorial]: https://csharp.net-tutorials.com/data-types/the-char-type/\r\n[culture-info]: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.globalization.cultureinfo\r\n[uint16]: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.uint16\r\n[string-info]: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.globalization.stringinfo\r\n[runes]: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.text.rune\r\n[char-encoding-net]: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/base-types/character-encoding-introduction\r\n[surrogates]: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.char.issurrogate\r\n[is-control]: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.char.iscontrol\r\n[to-upper]: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.char.toupper\r\n[to-lower]: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.char.tolower\r\n[to-upper-invariant]: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.char.toupperinvariant\r\n[to-lower-invariant]: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.char.tolowerinvariant\r\n[is-digit]: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.char.isdigit\r\n[get-next-text-element]: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.globalization.stringinfo.getnexttextelement\r\n[compare-to]: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.char.compareto\r\n",
    "introduction": "# Introduction\r\n\r\nThe C# `char` type is a 16 bit quantity to represent the smallest addressable components of text.\r\nMultiple `char`s can comprise a string such as `\"word\"` or `char`s can be\r\nprocessed independently. Their literals have single quotes e.g. `'A'`.\r\n\r\nC# `char`s support UTF-16 Unicode encoding so in addition to the latin character set\r\npretty much all the writing systems used worldwide can be represented,\r\ne.g. the Greek letter `'β'`.\r\n\r\nThere are many builtin library methods to inspect and manipulate `char`s. These\r\ncan be found as static methods of the `System.Char` class.\r\n"
