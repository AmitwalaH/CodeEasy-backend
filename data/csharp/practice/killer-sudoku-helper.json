All other cells are empty.][one-solution-img]\r\n\r\n## Example 2: Cage with several combinations\r\n\r\nIn a 2-digit cage with a sum 10, there are 4 possible combinations:\r\n\r\n- 19\r\n- 28\r\n- 37\r\n- 46\r\n\r\n![Sudoku grid, all squares empty except for the middle column, column 5, which has 8 rows filled.\r\nEach continguous two rows form a killer cage and are marked as grouped together.\r\nFrom top to bottom: first group is a cell with value 1 and a pencil mark indicating a cage sum of 10, cell with value 9.\r\nSecond group is a cell with value 2 and a pencil mark of 10, cell with value 8.\r\nThird group is a cell with value 3 and a pencil mark of 10, cell with value 7.\r\nFourth group is a cell with value 4 and a pencil mark of 10, cell with value 6.\r\nThe last cell in the column is empty.][four-solutions-img]\r\n\r\n## Example 3: Cage with several combinations that is restricted\r\n\r\nIn a 2-digit cage with a sum 10, where the column already contains a 1 and a 4, there are 2 possible combinations:\r\n\r\n- 28\r\n- 37\r\n\r\n19 and 46 are not possible due to the 1 and 4 in the column according to standard Sudoku rules.\r\n\r\n![Sudoku grid, all squares empty except for the middle column, column 5, which has 8 rows filled.\r\nThe first row contains a 4, the second is empty, and the third contains a 1.\r\nThe 1 is highlighted in red to indicate a mistake.\r\nThe last 6 rows in the column form killer cages of two cells each.\r\nFrom top to bottom: first group is a cell with value 2 and a pencil mark indicating a cage sum of 10, cell with value 8.\r\nSecond group is a cell with value 3 and a pencil mark of 10, cell with value 7.\r\nThird group is a cell with value 1, highlighted in red, and a pencil mark of 10, cell with value 9.][not-possible-img]\r\n\r\n## Trying it yourself\r\n\r\nIf you want to give an approachable Killer Sudoku a go, you can try out [this puzzle][clover-puzzle] by Clover, featured by [Mark Goodliffe on Cracking The Cryptic on the 21st of June 2021][goodliffe-video].\r\n\r\nYou can also find Killer Sudokus in varying difficulty in numerous newspapers, as well as Sudoku apps, books and websites.\r\n\r\n## Credit\r\n\r\nThe screenshots above have been generated using F-Puzzles.com, a Puzzle Setting Tool by Eric Fox.\r\n\r\n[sudoku-rules]: https://masteringsudoku.com/sudoku-rules-beginners/\r\n[killer-guide]: https://masteringsudoku.com/killer-sudoku/\r\n[one-solution-img]: https://assets.exercism.org/images/exercises/killer-sudoku-helper/example1.png\r\n[four-solutions-img]: https://assets.exercism.org/images/exercises/killer-sudoku-helper/example2.png\r\n[not-possible-img]: https://assets.exercism.org/images/exercises/killer-sudoku-helper/example3.png\r\n[clover-puzzle]: https://app.crackingthecryptic.com/sudoku/HqTBn3Pr6R\r\n[goodliffe-video]: https://youtu.be/c_NjEbFEeW0?t=1180\r\n",
