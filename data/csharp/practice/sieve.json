Find the next unmarked number (skipping over marked numbers).\r\n   This is a prime number.\r\n2. Mark all the multiples of that prime number as **not** prime.\r\n\r\nRepeat the steps until you've gone through every number.\r\nAt the end, all the unmarked numbers are prime.\r\n\r\n~~~~exercism/note\r\nThe Sieve of Eratosthenes marks off multiples of each prime using addition (repeatedly adding the prime) or multiplication (directly computing its multiples), rather than checking each number for divisibility.\r\n\r\nThe tests don't check that you've implemented the algorithm, only that you've come up with the correct primes.\r\n~~~~\r\n\r\n## Example\r\n\r\nLet's say you're finding the primes less than or equal to 10.\r\n\r\n- Write out 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, leaving them all unmarked.\r\n\r\n  ```text\r\n  2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10\r\n  ```\r\n\r\n- 2 is unmarked and is therefore a prime.\r\n  Mark 4, 6, 8 and 10 as \"not prime\".\r\n\r\n  ```text\r\n  2 3 [4] 5 [6] 7 [8] 9 [10]\r\n  ↑\r\n  ```\r\n\r\n- 3 is unmarked and is therefore a prime.\r\n  Mark 6 and 9 as not prime _(marking 6 is optional - as it's already been marked)_.\r\n\r\n  ```text\r\n  2 3 [4] 5 [6] 7 [8] [9] [10]\r\n    ↑\r\n  ```\r\n\r\n- 4 is marked as \"not prime\", so we skip over it.\r\n\r\n  ```text\r\n  2 3 [4] 5 [6] 7 [8] [9] [10]\r\n       ↑\r\n  ```\r\n\r\n- 5 is unmarked and is therefore a prime.\r\n  Mark 10 as not prime _(optional - as it's already been marked)_.\r\n\r\n  ```text\r\n  2 3 [4] 5 [6] 7 [8] [9] [10]\r\n          ↑\r\n  ```\r\n\r\n- 6 is marked as \"not prime\", so we skip over it.\r\n\r\n  ```text\r\n  2 3 [4] 5 [6] 7 [8] [9] [10]\r\n             ↑\r\n  ```\r\n\r\n- 7 is unmarked and is therefore a prime.\r\n\r\n  ```text\r\n  2 3 [4] 5 [6] 7 [8] [9] [10]\r\n                ↑\r\n  ```\r\n\r\n- 8 is marked as \"not prime\", so we skip over it.\r\n\r\n  ```text\r\n  2 3 [4] 5 [6] 7 [8] [9] [10]\r\n                   ↑\r\n  ```\r\n\r\n- 9 is marked as \"not prime\", so we skip over it.\r\n\r\n  ```text\r\n  2 3 [4] 5 [6] 7 [8] [9] [10]\r\n                       ↑\r\n  ```\r\n\r\n- 10 is marked as \"not prime\", so we stop as there are no more numbers to check.\r\n\r\n  ```text\r\n  2 3 [4] 5 [6] 7 [8] [9] [10]\r\n                           ↑\r\n  ```\r\n\r\nYou've examined all the numbers and found that 2, 3, 5, and 7 are still unmarked, meaning they're the primes less than or equal to 10.\r\n",
