    "hints": "# Hints\r\n\r\n## General\r\n\r\n-  This challenge is all about calculating if a point falls _on, in, or outside_ a given circle.\r\n-  There are two different ways of calculating if a point falls on, in, or outside a circle.\r\n   - This _Stack Overflow_ Post: [Equation for Testing if a Point is Inside a Circle][point-circle-equation] outlines one method.\r\n   - This _DoubleRoot_ post [Position of a point relative to a circle][point-to-circle] outlines a different one.\r\n   - This _Math is Fun_ post covers a more general [Distance Between 2 Points][distance-between-two-points] calculation.\r\n- Because the dart board is a set of _concentric_ circles, the order in which you calculate points could change the answer significantly.\r\n  You should pay attention to which direction your calculations \"move\" in.\r\n-  Remember that this exercise has many potential solutions and many paths you can take along the way.\r\n   No path is manifestly \"better\" than another, although a particular path may be more interesting or better suited to what you want to learn or explore right now.\r\n-  Some paths may trade speed for clarity.\r\n   Others might take up more memory but be more scalable or maintainable.\r\n-  We encourage you to try out more than one programming strategy to see what happens.\r\n\r\n[point-circle-equation]: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/481144/equation-for-testing-if-a-point-is-inside-a-circle\r\n[point-to-circle]: https://doubleroot.in/lessons/circle/position-of-a-point/\r\n[distance-between-two-points]: https://www.mathsisfun.com/algebra/distance-2-points.html\r\n"
