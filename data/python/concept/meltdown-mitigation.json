    "instructions": "# Instructions\r\n\r\nIn this exercise, we'll develop a simple control system for a nuclear reactor.\r\n\r\nFor a reactor to produce the power it must be in a state of _criticality_.\r\nIf the reactor is in a state less than criticality, it can become damaged.\r\nIf the reactor state goes beyond criticality, it can overload and result in a meltdown.\r\nWe want to mitigate the chances of meltdown and correctly manage reactor state.\r\n\r\nThe following three tasks are all related to writing code for maintaining ideal reactor state.\r\n\r\n## 1. Check for criticality\r\n\r\nThe first thing a control system has to do is check if the reactor is _balanced in criticality_.\r\nA reactor is said to be balanced in criticality if it satisfies the following conditions:\r\n\r\n- The temperature is less than 800 K.\r\n- The number of neutrons emitted per second is greater than 500.\r\n- The product of temperature and neutrons emitted per second is less than 500000.\r\n\r\nImplement the function `is_criticality_balanced()` that takes `temperature` measured in kelvin and `neutrons_emitted` as parameters, and returns `True` if the criticality conditions are met, `False` if not.\r\n\r\n```python\r\n>>> is_criticality_balanced(750, 600)\r\nTrue\r\n```\r\n\r\n## 2. Determine the Power output range\r\n\r\nOnce the reactor has started producing power its efficiency needs to be determined.\r\nEfficiency can be grouped into 4 bands:\r\n\r\n1. `green` -> efficiency of 80% or more,\r\n2. `orange` -> efficiency of less than 80% but at least 60%,\r\n3. `red` -> efficiency below 60%, but still 30% or more,\r\n4. `black` ->  less than 30% efficient.\r\n\r\nThe percentage value can be calculated as `(generated_power/theoretical_max_power)*100`\r\nwhere `generated_power` = `voltage` * `current`.\r\nNote that the percentage value is usually not an integer number, so make sure to consider the\r\nproper use of the `<` and `<=` comparisons.\r\n\r\nImplement the function `reactor_efficiency(<voltage>, <current>, <theoretical_max_power>)`, with three parameters: `voltage`,\r\n`current`, and `theoretical_max_power`.\r\nThis function should return the efficiency band of the reactor : 'green', 'orange', 'red', or 'black'.\r\n\r\n```python\r\n>>> reactor_efficiency(200,50,15000)\r\n'orange'\r\n```\r\n\r\n## 3. Fail Safe Mechanism\r\n\r\nYour final task involves creating a fail-safe mechanism to avoid overload and meltdown.\r\nThis mechanism will determine if the reactor is below, at, or above the ideal criticality threshold.\r\nCriticality can then be increased, decreased, or stopped by inserting (or removing) control rods into the reactor.\r\n\r\nImplement the function called `fail_safe()`, which takes 3 parameters: `temperature` measured in kelvin,\r\n`neutrons_produced_per_second`, and `threshold`, and outputs a status code for the reactor.\r\n\r\n- If `temperature * neutrons_produced_per_second` < 90% of `threshold`, output a status code of 'LOW'\r\n  indicating that control rods must be removed to produce power.\r\n\r\n- If the value `temperature * neutrons_produced_per_second` is within 10% of the `threshold` (so either 0-10% less than the threshold, at the threshold, or 0-10% greater than the threshold), the reactor is in _criticality_ and the status code of 'NORMAL' should be output, indicating that the reactor is in optimum condition and control rods are in an ideal position.\r\n\r\n- If `temperature * neutrons_produced_per_second` is not in the above-stated ranges, the reactor is\r\n  going into meltdown and a status code of 'DANGER' must be passed to immediately shut down the reactor.\r\n\r\n```python\r\n>>> fail_safe(temperature=1000, neutrons_produced_per_second=30, threshold=5000)\r\n'DANGER'\r\n```\r\n",
