  "about": "# Binary, Octal, and Hexadecimal\r\n\r\nBinary, octal, and hexadecimal (_also known as hex_) are different [numeral systems][numeral-systems] with different bases.\r\nBinary is base 2, octal is base 8, and hexadecimal is base 16.\r\nNormal integers are base 10 in python.\r\nBinary, octal, and hexadecimal are all representations of integers.\r\nWhich means that they represent positive and negative numbers (_including zero_) without fractions or decimals, and support all the operations that we can do with integers.\r\n\r\n## Binary\r\n\r\n[Binary][binary] is a base 2 numeral system, using only the digits 0 and 1.\r\nIt commonly represents the 0 (\"off\") and 1 (\"on\") states of electrical flow through transistors and switches in computers, as well as the positive and negative charges in magnetic storage media.\r\nBinary can represent all the integers that are used in base 10.\r\n\r\nA snippet from the base 2 system looks like this, although it continues infinitely and doesn't stop at 128:\r\n\r\n| 128      | 64       | 32       | 16       | 8        | 4        | 2        | 1        |\r\n| -------- | -------- | -------- | -------- | -------- | -------- | -------- | -------- |\r\n| 2 \\*\\* 7 | 2 \\*\\* 6 | 2 \\*\\* 5 | 2 \\*\\* 4 | 2 \\*\\* 3 | 2 \\*\\* 2 | 2 \\*\\* 1 | 2 \\*\\* 0 |\r\n\r\nSo if we want to represent the number 6, it would in binary be: 110\r\n\r\n| Place value   | 4   | 2   | 1   |\r\n| ------------- | --- | --- | --- |\r\n| Binary number | 1   | 1   | 0   |\r\n\r\nAnd the operation would be: `4 + 2 + 0 = 6`\r\n\r\nAnother example: 19\r\n\r\n| Place value   | 16  | 8   | 4   | 2   | 1   |\r\n| ------------- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\r\n| Binary number | 1   | 0   | 0   | 1   | 1   |\r\n\r\nThe binary number would be: 10011\r\nAnd the operation would be: `16 + 0 + 0 + 2 + 1 = 19`\r\n\r\n## Binary in Python\r\n\r\nIn Python, we can represent binary literals using the `0b` prefix.\r\nIf we write `0b10011`, Python will interpret it as a binary number and convert it to base 10.\r\n\r\n```python\r\n# 0b10011\r\n>>> 0b10011\r\n19\r\n\r\n>>> type(0b10011)\r\n<class 'int'>\r\n```\r\n\r\nBinary in Python is just a different way of writing an integer and so the binary representation **is an integer** for all mathematical operations.\r\n\r\nIf you write a number with a `0b` prefix that is not in the binary system, it will raise a `SyntaxError`.\r\n\r\n```python\r\nTraceback (most recent call last):\r\n  File \"c:\\binary.py\", line 1, in <module>\r\n    0b10211\r\nSyntaxError: invalid digit '2' in binary literal\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Operations with Binary Numbers\r\n\r\nSince binary numbers are integers, we can perform all operations on them that we can with integers.\r\n\r\n```python\r\n# addition\r\n>>> 0b10011 + 0b10011\r\n38\r\n\r\n# multiplication\r\n>>> 0b10011 * 0b10011\r\n361\r\n```\r\n\r\nWe can also perform operations between both binary and integer representations.\r\nHowever, the usual mathematical operator rules apply:  dividing two binary numbers or integer numbers will return a `float`, even if the division does not result in a decimal portion.\r\n\r\n```python\r\n>>> 0b10011 + 19\r\n38\r\n\r\n>>> 0b10011/0b10011\r\n1.0\r\n\r\n>>> 0b10011/3\r\n6.333333333333333\r\n\r\n### Converting to and from Binary Representation\r\n\r\nPython will automatically convert a binary literal into `int`.\r\n To convert an `int` into a binary representation, use the built-in [`bin()`][bin] function.\r\n`bin()` will return a `str` of the binary equivalent with the prefix `0b` .\r\n\r\n```python\r\n>>> bin(19)\r\n'0b10011'\r\n```\r\n\r\nTo convert a binary literal to an integer, we can use the built-in `int()` function, and pass a string of the binary representation and a base argument:\r\n\r\n```python\r\n>>> int(\"0b10011\", 2)\r\n19\r\n```\r\n\r\nGiving the wrong base (_or an invalid binary representation_) will raise a `ValueError`:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nTraceback (most recent call last):\r\n  File \"c:\\binary.py\", line 4, in <module>\r\n    int(\"0b10011\", 3)\r\nValueError: invalid literal for int() with base 3: '0b10011'\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Binary Methods\r\n\r\nThere are also some special [methods][numeral-systems] that we can use on binary numbers.\r\n\r\n\r\n[`<int>.bit_length()`][bit_length] will return the number of bits that are needed to represent the number:\r\n\r\n```python\r\n>>> 0b11011.bit_length()\r\n5\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n[`<int>.bit_count()`][bit_count] will return the number of **ones** in the binary number.\r\nFor example, `bit_count()` on '0b11011' will return 4:\r\n\r\n```python\r\n>>> 0b11011.bit_count()\r\n4\r\n~~~~exercism/note\r\nIf you are working locally, `bit_count()` requires at least Python 3.10.\r\nThe Exercism online editor currently supports all features through Python 3.11.\r\n~~~~ \r\n\r\n\r\n## Octal\r\n\r\n[Octal][octal] is a base 8 numeral system.\r\nIt uses the digits 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7.\r\n\r\nIn Python, we can represent octal numbers using the `0o` prefix.\r\nAs with binary, Python automatically converts an octal representation to an `int`.\r\n\r\n```python\r\n# 0o123\r\n>>> 0o123\r\n83\r\n```\r\n\r\nAs with binary, octal numbers **are ints** and support all integer operations.\r\nPrefixing a number with `0o` that is not in the octal system will raise a `SyntaxError`.\r\n\r\n ### Converting to and from Octal Representation\r\n \r\n\r\nTo convert an `int` into an octal representation, you can use the built-in [`oct()`][oct] function.\r\nThis acts similarly to the `bin()` function, returning a string:\r\n\r\n```python\r\n>>> oct(83)\r\n'0o123'\r\n\r\nTo convert an octal number to an integer, we can use the `int()` function, passing an octal string representation and the base (8) as arguments:\r\n\r\n```python\r\n>>> int(\"0o123\", 8)\r\n83\r\n```\r\n\r\nAs with binary, giving the wrong base will raise a `ValueError`.\r\n\r\n### Hexadecimal\r\n\r\n[Hexadecimal][hexadecimal] is a base 16 numeral system.\r\nIt uses the digits 0 - 9 and the letters A, B, C, D, E, and F.\r\nA is 10, B is 11, C is 12, D is 13, E is 14, and F is 15.\r\n\r\nWe can represent hexadecimal numbers in Python using the `0x` prefix.\r\nAs with binary and octal, Python will automatically convert hexadecimal literals to `int`.\r\n\r\n```python\r\n# 0x123\r\n>>> 0x123\r\n291\r\n```\r\n\r\nAs with binary and octal - hexadecimal literals **are ints**, and you can perform all integer operations.  \r\nPrefixing a non-hexadecimal number with `0x` will raise a `SyntaxError`.\r\n\r\n\r\n###  Converting to and from Hexadecimal Representation\r\n\r\nTo convert an `int` into a hexadecimal representation, you can use the built-in [`hex()`][hex] function.\r\nThis acts similarly to the `bin()` function, returning a string:\r\n\r\n```python\r\n>>> hex(291)\r\n'0x123'\r\n\r\nTo convert a hexadecimal representation to an integer, we can use the `int()` function, passing a hexadecimal string with the base (16) as arguments:\r\n\r\n```python\r\n>>> int(\"0x123\", 16)\r\n291\r\n```\r\n\r\nAs with binary and octal, giving the wrong base will raise a `ValueError`.\r\n\r\n\r\n[binary]:
