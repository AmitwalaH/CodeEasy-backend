    "introduction": "# Introduction\r\n\r\n## Integers\r\n\r\nIntegers are whole numbers that belong to the set `{..., -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, ...}`.\r\nThe maximum and minimum values of an integer is determined by the system PHP runs in.\r\nTypically for most modern systems, the integer is a 64-bit value -- meaning it can represent `-9_223_372_036_854_775_808` to `9_223_372_036_854_775_807` inclusive.\r\n\r\n```php\r\n<?php\r\n\r\n$a = 1234;\r\n$a = 1_234_567;\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou can write integer literal values in other than base 10 using a base prefix:\r\n\r\n```php\r\n<?php\r\n\r\n$a = 0123; // octal number (equivalent to 83 decimal)\r\n$a = 0o123; // octal number (as of PHP 8.1.0)\r\n$a = 0x1A; // hexadecimal number (equivalent to 26 decimal)\r\n$a = 0b11111111; // binary number (equivalent to 255 decimal)\r\n```\r\n\r\n> Taken from PHP's [documentation][syntax]\r\n\r\n## Floating Point Numbers\r\n\r\nFloating point numbers are used in PHP to represent a subset of real numbers.\r\nThey start with one or more digits separated by a decimal separator.\r\n\r\n```php\r\n<?php\r\n\r\n$a = 1.234; \r\n$b = 1.2e3; \r\n$c = 7E-10;\r\n$d = 1_234.567; // as of PHP 7.4.0\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Common pitfalls\r\n\r\nNot all numbers and arithmetic operations can be performed with floating point numbers.\r\nUsing floating point numbers to represent dollars and cents can lead to rounding errors.\r\n\r\n```php\r\n<?php\r\n\r\n$result = 0.1 + 0.2; // => 0.30000000000000004\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Arithmetic Operators\r\n\r\nPHP provides a number of operators for performing arithmetic operations. PHP follows the standard mathematical order of operations for its arithmetic operators. The operators that are provided by PHP are:\r\n\r\n* Identity (+)\r\n* Negation (-)\r\n* Addition (+)\r\n* Subtraction (-)\r\n* Multiplication (*)\r\n* Division (/)\r\n* Modulo (%)\r\n* Exponentiation (**)\r\n\r\n```php\r\n$moles = +'10';\r\n$aLotOfMoles = 6.022 * 10**23 * $moles;\r\n```\r\n\r\n[syntax]: https://www.php.net/manual/en/language.types.integer.php#language.types.integer.syntax\r\n",
    "instructions": "# Instructions\r\n\r\nLilly loves cooking.\r\nShe wants to throw a pizza party with her friends.\r\nTo make the most of her ingredients, she needs to know how much of each ingredient she requires before starting.\r\n\r\nTo solve this, Lilly has drafted a program to automate some of the planning but needs your help finishing it.\r\nWill you help Lilly throw the proportionally perfect pizza party?\r\n\r\n## 1. A Dough Ratio\r\n\r\nLilly is a fan of thin, crispy pizzas with a thinner crust.\r\nThe dough needed for the middle is a minimum 200g, but every person it serves requires another 20g of dough.\r\n\r\n`grams = pizzas * ((persons * 20) + 200)`\r\n\r\nLilly needs a function that:\r\n\r\n- Takes the number of pizzas\r\n- The number of persons each pizza will serve\r\n- And returns the dough needed to the nearest gram.\r\n\r\nFor example, to make 4 pizzas that feed 8 people:\r\n\r\n```php\r\n<?php\r\n\r\n$pizza_pi = new PizzaPi();\r\n$pizza_pi->calculateDoughRequirement(4, 8);\r\n// => 1440\r\n```\r\n\r\n## 2. A Splash of Sauce\r\n\r\nLilly is meticulous when applying her sauce, but the size of her pizzas can be inconsistent.\r\nFrom her experience, she knows that it takes 125mL of sauce per pizza.\r\nLilly needs a function that calculates how many cans of sauce to buy.\r\n\r\n`cans of sauce = pizzas * sauce per pizza / sauce can volume`\r\n\r\nFor example, given Lilly needs to make 8 pizzas, and each can is 250mL:\r\n\r\n```php\r\n<?php\r\n\r\n$pizza_pi = new PizzaPi();\r\n$pizza_pi->calculateSauceRequirement(8, 250);\r\n// => 4\r\n```\r\n\r\n## 3. Some Cheese, Please\r\n\r\nCheese comes in perfect cubes and is sold by size.\r\n\r\nThe formula Lily uses is not the formula for the area of the pizza since she does _not_ want the cheese to cover the entire area.\r\nShe decided to use the following formula to determine how many pizzas of some diameter (`diameter`) can be made from a cheese cube of some side-length (`cheese_dimension`):\r\n\r\n`pizzas = (cheese_dimension³) / (thickness * PI * diameter)`\r\n\r\nCreate a function that:\r\n\r\n- Takes a side-length dimension of a cheese cube\r\n- Takes the desired thickness of the cheese layer\r\n- Takes the diameter of the pizza\r\n- And uses Lilly's formula to return the number of pizzas that can be made while rounding down.\r\n\r\nFor example, given a 25x25x25cm cheese cube, 0.5cm thick cheese layer and pizzas 30cm in diameter:\r\n\r\n```php\r\n<?php\r\n\r\n$pizza_pi = new PizzaPi();\r\n$pizza_pi->calculateCheeseCubeCoverage(25, 0.5, 30);\r\n// => 331\r\n```\r\n\r\n## 4. A Fair Share\r\n\r\nFinally, Lilly wants her pizzas to divide into 8 slices each and distributed evenly among her friends.\r\n\r\nCreate a function that:\r\n\r\n- Takes a number of pizzas and number of friends\r\n- and returns the number of slices that will be left over if each person takes an equal number of slices.\r\n\r\nFor example:\r\n\r\n```php\r\n<?php\r\n\r\n$pizza_pi = new PizzaPi();\r\n$pizza_pi->calculateLeftOverSlices(2, 4);\r\n// => 0\r\n$pizza_pi->calculateLeftOverSlices(4, 3);\r\n// => 2\r\n```\r\n",
