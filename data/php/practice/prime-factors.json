So let's move on to our next divisor, 3.\r\n- 3 goes cleanly into 15, leaving 5.\r\n  - 3 does not go cleanly into 5. The next possible factor is 4.\r\n  - 4 does not go cleanly into 5. The next possible factor is 5.\r\n- 5 does go cleanly into 5.\r\n- We're left only with 1, so now, we're done.\r\n\r\nOur successful divisors in that computation represent the list of prime\r\nfactors of 60: 2, 2, 3, and 5.\r\n\r\nYou can check this yourself:\r\n\r\n- 2 * 2 * 3 * 5\r\n- = 4 * 15\r\n- = 60\r\n- Success!\r\n",
