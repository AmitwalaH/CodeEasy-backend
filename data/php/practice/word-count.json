DO YOU HEAR ME?\r\n\r\nThe ordering of the word counts in the results doesn't matter.\r\n\r\nHere's an example that incorporates several of the elements discussed above:\r\n\r\n- simple words\r\n- contractions\r\n- numbers\r\n- case insensitive words\r\n- punctuation (including apostrophes) to separate words\r\n- different forms of whitespace to separate words\r\n\r\n`\"That's the password: 'PASSWORD 123'!\", cried the Special Agent.\\nSo I fled.`\r\n\r\nThe mapping for this subtitle would be:\r\n\r\n```text\r\n123: 1\r\nagent: 1\r\ncried: 1\r\nfled: 1\r\ni: 1\r\npassword: 2\r\nso: 1\r\nspecial: 1\r\nthat's: 1\r\nthe: 2\r\n```\r\n",
