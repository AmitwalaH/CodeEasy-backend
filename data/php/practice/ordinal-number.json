For zero (0) just return \"0\" as string.\r\n\r\nOrdinal number are numbers that describe the position of something in a list.\r\nIt is this context that ordinal numbers will be used, using an English-spelled name of an ordinal number.\r\n\r\nThe ordinal numbers are (at least, one form of them):\r\n\r\n```\r\n1st 2nd 3rd 4th 5th... 9th 10th 11th 12th... 20th 21st 22nd 23rd 24th... etc.\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo entering a normal number results in its ordinal equivalent:\r\n\r\n```\r\n1 -> 1st\r\n2 -> 2nd\r\n3 -> 3rd\r\n(and so on...)\r\n```\r\n",
